The Ergo Node is part of Ergo's peer-to-peer network which hosts and synchronises a copy of the entire Ergo blockchain. 

There is no financial incentive to run a node, but doing so helps increase the security of the network.

Public nodes can be seen on [nodespyder](https://ergo.nodespyder.io/). (Note that unless you are running the node on a publicly accessible web-server, your node should be protected by your router and not visible on this website.)

If you want to install a node see [this page](install/)
