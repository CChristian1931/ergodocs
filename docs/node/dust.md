## Dust

Some users (miners in particular) may have noticed their Yoroi wallet becoming slow and unusable with the increasing number of transactions generated


This page provides an overview of how to recover access to your coins in this case.

## Why does this happen?

Ergo is based on the extended-UTXO model. A side-effect of UTXOs is a term coined *dust*. 

Dust refers to fractional values of ERG and is usually below the protocol fee, miner wallets are prone to becoming dusty with the stream of transactions coming into thier wallet.


## Troubleshooting

### If you still have access to your wallet

- Use the **Send All Assets** function in yoroi to collect all your UTXO boxes into one. 
- Switch to the Mobile Wallet. 

### If your wallet is unresponsive

- If on Android, switch to the mobile wallet.
- If on iOS, multiple addresses are not supported yet so you will need to use the node.



### I've resynced and my balance is still 0
