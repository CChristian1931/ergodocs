It's no secret that the best way to learn something is to try and explain it - so keep a note of your progress while learning and claim some of the bounties available for [Tutorials and Guides for developers](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/15)!

## FAQ

### Are they any paid roles for community management/moderation?

While there are several paid community managers within the ergo ecosystem, they are usually promoted from within. If this is somewhere you excel, get involved with the ecosystem, keep ontop of new products launching and make yourself useful in a budding project. 

### Are you looking for developers?

While the Ergo Foundation does occassionally advertise [full-time roles](https://ergoplatform.org/en/careers/) these are usually senior roles. The quickest way to get involved is to start completing some (paid) [bounties](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/). There is plenty of development work available. 

### Are you looking for regional managers? 

If you're interested in starting a regional branch - this can involve running regional chats, hosting meet-ups, etc. This will be incentivised via an ambassador programme, however the details is still being worked out. 

Check [our chats](https://linktr.ee/ergoplatform) to ensure a branch doesn't already exist for your region.
