### The Delphi Project

[The Delphi Project](https://delphiproject.org/#) aims to help anyone explore, run, and launch decentralized oracles on the Ergo blockchain, or simply learn more about oracle pools. Read their full submission [here](https://hackmd.io/@abchris/S1dHZcwyc)

### NightOwl

A Decentralised Casino ontop Ergo.

See their [presentation](pdf/Night_Owl_-_Ergo_Hack_lll_Presentation_Final.pdf)

### ErgoDNS

We have created a MVP for ergo-dns service to resolve Ergo Names to the wallet addresses.

**Key Features**

- Registration - Ownership of Ergo Names can be established by minting Ergo Name NFT.
- Resolution - ergo-dns service can be used to resolve Ergo Name to Wallet Address where Ergo Name NFT currently resides.
Transfer - When ownership of Ergo Name NFT changes, the resolution changes automatically.

The service is fully decentralised and all the ownership data is maintained on-chain.

### SkyHarbor

SkyHarbor will be the primary place to quickly buy and sell NFT’s on the Ergo blockchain using Ergo Smart Contracts. Connect your dApp connector and immediately put your NFT up for sale for the price you’re looking for, or buy an NFT from our verified collections (ERGnomes, Ergosaurs, Space Farmers, etc...). It will also be fast and efficient, making it super easy and simple to interact with the blockchain, using databases and the latest infrastructure to make the website blazing fast.

### GuapSwap

[GuapSwap](pdf/GuapSwap_-_ErgoHack3_Project_Report.pdf) is a fully decentralized smart contract profit swapping service on the Ergo Blockchain.


### HYPO10USE

[HYPO10USE](https://github.com/hypo10use/quid-games) joins us again after getting their POC live in ERGOHACKII. 


### ergo-castanet

ergo-castanet uses Petri Nets as a tool to define and validate Smart Contract Protocol specifications (EIP-0006), for creation of headless dApps.
Using a Colored Petri Net for Smart Contract orchestration and testing

### anetaBTC

> This weekend we released a sneak peek of our frontend. Over the weekend we were able to integrate Yoroi and Nautilus Wallet into the anetaBTC app.
Users can connect their Yoroi or Nautilus Wallet and sign transactions. The next step is writing the ErgoScript smart contracts.
We were also able to integrate our analytics dashboard into the bridge app and our developers will soon release our updated analytics page to track the stats of the protocol.

### Stealth Addresses

### Wallets

With Nautilus nearing the finish line with Ledger they extended an invitation to help any other projects integrate either Ledger or the dApp connector.

> **Nautilus**

- Ledger support added using the ledgerjs-hw-app-ergo binding library
 - All ledger interactions are done, however transactions are getting rejected by the mempool due to an issue on the device app, which is being fixed by tesseract team.
- Helped another teams with dApp connector integration

Implementation: https://github.com/capt-nemo429/nautilus-wallet/pull/6
Special thanks to @zuozas for the amazing Ledger illustrations.

> **Satergo**

Project: Implement Ledger support into Satergo

- Implemented HID for Nano S and Nano X
- Implemented Speculos Ledger emulator interface
- Implemented the Ergo Ledger app protocol in Java
- Created utils to attest and sign transactions
- Integrated Ledger support into program
 
Both the Ledger interface library and the Ergo Ledger app protocol are reusable and can easily be integrated to other Java Ergo applications.

> **SAFEW**

- Ledger Support
- ErgoMixer support
- Transaction History
