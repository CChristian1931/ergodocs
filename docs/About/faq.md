## Basics
- **What is the teams background?** | Ergo is designed and implemented by a team of experienced developers and researchers, who hold publications and PhDs in cryptography, compiler theory, blockchain technology, and cryptographic e-cash. The team also has a solid background in core development with such cryptocurrencies and blockchain frameworks as Nxt, Scorex and Waves. Alexander 'kushti' Chepurnoy, was a co-founder of smartcontract.com (now Chainlink), a core developer at NXT (first PoS), and one of the first employees at IOHK, where he was a Research Fellow and Team Scorex Manager. The full team can be seen on Ergo's [Hall of Fame](https://ergoplatform.org/en/hall_of_fame/).
- **Why 'Ergo'?** | “Ergo means “therefore” in Latin, but “work” in Greek. Initially, the name was chosen to point to the fact that the design of the cryptocurrency is ERGOnomical.
- **What is the emission schedule?** | [Emission Schedule](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/) with a maximum supply of **97,739,925** Ergs, to be completed in **8 years** after launch. 
- **When was Ergo launched?** | July, 2019. The previous price spike was a different token (Ergo-First-Year-Token), if you view the chart by market-cap it is accurate.
- [**Where can I buy Erg?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/n9usw5/how_to_purchase_ergo_on_coinex_using_cardano_or/) | KuCoin, CoinEx, TradeOgre, gate.io.
- **Where can I store Erg?** | Yoroi or the Android Wallet.
- **Is there mobile support?** | Android only currently, iOS in development
- **Can we use a hardware wallet?** |  Ledger support underway.  Workaround: You can move your Erg to [waves.exchange](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008681773-Waves-WAVES-) and stake your erg through that.
- **Can I stake ERG?** | No, Ergo is a Proof of Work coin - you can however provide liquidity on either the CoinEx AMM pool (watch out for impermanent loss!), or SigmaUSD. However, dApp tokenisation is coming - [A Solution for staking](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-solution-for-staking/1057)

>“It's one of the most revolutionary cryptocurrencies ever built. Got so many crazy ideas like sigma protocols and pruning the blockchain and roller chains. All this crazy stuff. Even has a proof of no premine. So really a technological marvel in many respects, and it reflects about 8 years of knowledge that Alex has amassed as both a researcher and a developer. Super concise code and it blows my mind that the market cap is where it's at. It should be a top 10 coin or top 15 coin" — Charles Hoskinson

## Proof of Work

Ergo was created for regular people, PoW allows for a fair start and true decentralistion. It's also widely studied, and has very high-security guarantees - which are essential for having useful contractual, programmable money that's ready today. 

Here's CH talking a bit about [consensus](https://youtu.be/nkr1EKQrVeQ)

- **[Why Proof-of-Work?](https://ergonaut.space/Cardano)** | It's tried and tested (the Lindy effect), and has some advantages over PoS. 
- **[What about 51% attacks?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/mgpnb7/51_attack_possibilities/)** | Not a significant problem, more pools are being added. 
- [Ergo's Efficiency and interplay with PoS - Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/nbdism/ergos_efficiency_and_interplay_with_pos/)
- Can I mine ERG? | To mine, you will need a dedicated GPU (AMD/Intel), see [this page on mining](https://ergonaut.space/Mining)
- [What will Erg bring to ADA?](https://ergonaut.space/en/Cardano)


## Features

- [Storage Rent](https://ergonaut.space/en/Autolykos) | After four years, miners can charge fees for unmoved erg. Stabilising miner income and preventing lost coins as we see in BTC. 
- [Sigma Protocols](https://ergonaut.space/en/sigma-protocols) | Ergo’s smart contracts and DeFi functionality are built on Sigma protocols – a powerful, flexible class of zero-knowledge proofs. Find out more about why they’re so important, and how they put Ergo head and shoulders above the competition.
- [eUTxO](https://ergonaut.space/en/eUTXO) | Based on the UTXO model of Bitcoin, similar extended-UTXO model as Cardano, allowing interoperability. 
- [NiPoPoWs](https://ergonaut.space/en/NiPoPoWs) | Verify proof of work without downloading the headers. Enables light-clients during in places with poor internet - and light mining (not having to download the entire chain)


## dApps 

Ergo already has several functional decentralised applications | [sigmaverse.io](https://sigmaverse.io)

- [ErgoMixer](https://ergonaut.space/en/ErgoMixer) | **the first working non-custodial, programmable, non-interactive mixer in the cryptocurrency space**. 
- [SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io) | DAI-like Stablecoin - without liquidations. 
- [AuctionHouse](https://ergoauctions.org) | Working NFT marketplace.
- [Oracle-Pools](https://ergonaut.space/Oracle-Pools) | More efficient and programmable than using multiple single oracle data points such as in Chainlink’s oracle design. We build hierarchies of confidence using oracle pools and pools of oracle pools in Ergo. It’s faster, cheaper, and more beneficial to the end-user.

### In-Development

- [ErgoDex](https://ergonaut.space/ergodex.pdf) | Decentralised exchange that runs ontop ADA & ERG. 
- [ErgoFund](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/FzcCv7pzTb2lQAamWsv1MQ) | Crowdfunding on Ergo 


## Use cases

Ergo is one of the most sophisticated protocols in the space with stateless clients, NiPoPoWS for light clients, and easy miner-voting on parameter changes (e.g, block size)

Ergo aims to provide an efficient, secure, and easy way to implement financial contracts that will be useful and survivable in the long term. There is plenty of uniqueness in Ergo but the most significant is probably Sigma protocols. These allow a true P2P system with privacy in mind. No one at the moment is able to build a trustless LETS system, multisig with no signers disclosure, trustless payment networks or has real ring signatures that preserve zero knowledge. 


- **[Local Exchange Trading System](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-01-lets-start-the-discussion/)** - a local mutual credit association which members are allowed to create common credit money individually, with all the deals in the system written into a common ledger. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of such kind of community currency on top of a blockchain. LETS can be thought of as a mechanism to facilitate the velocity of trade, goods, and services out-with the existing monetary system, allowing us to create sustainable local economies.
- **[Smart contracts without gas fees.](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021_03_26_eth_vs_erg/)** Ergo’s native programming language — aka ErgoScript — enables the development of Turing complete contracts that completely bypass the need for any gas fee while providing other peripheral benefits such as estimation of script complexity before execution, a facet that helps in the active prevention of DoS attacks.
- **Ergo.Meta** - a unified set of design patterns for off-chain and sidechain solutions
- **[ErgoScript](https://ergonaut.space/en/Developers)**: a new advanced transactional language built from scratch by the team. Tutorials are available on [the website](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf and https://ergoplatform.org)/docs/AdvancedErgoScriptTutorial.pdf. It is a more advanced scripting language than Bitcoin while maintaining security and not introducing blockchain bloat problems. Scripting language in itself is non-Turing complete but applications ran on the platform can be made to be Turing complete as demonstrated in this peer-reviewed paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10116v1.pdf.
- **Rigorous research and scientific approach**: Ergo is based on original research, published at known peer-reviewed conferences. A list of scientific papers is available at [here](https://apograf.io/c/7MEY3), but Ergo is not limited by research and it also implements other novel scientific ideas.
- **Trustless Light Clients with Minimal Resource Requirements:** Ergo block header supports NiPoPoWs that enable synchronizing network by downloading < 1Mb of data. This is further made possible by the fact Ergo state is authenticated as detailed in [this paper from 2017](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/994.pdf)
- **New Economic Model**: Key feature of the new model is miners charge users a fee for any UTXO that remains unmoved for 4 years (“storage rent fee”). This accomplishes stable mining revenue to secure the network, prevents “state bloat” and enables a short release schedule – Ergo emission fully completes in just 8 years. [Details in this paper](https://fc18.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/bitcoin18-final18.pdf)
- **Mined from Zero via PoW with no ICO or Pre-mine**. It is about a hope to achieve a fair distribution of Ergs as possible to enhance decentralization.
- **Decentralization First**: Core commitment of Development team and community. Top item in “Ergo Vision” section of white paper. Many of the above features’ main purpose is to achieve this goal.
- **Resiliency and Survivability**: Decentralization First is to accomplish this goal. Ergo should be alive and operational for an indefinite amount of time and Contractual Money contracts on Ergo should be able to survive for at least the length of a person’s lifetime despite a changing external environment.
- **Privacy**: Privacy is optional in Ergo, but it still beats a lot of privacy coins by default. You can actually put XMR on top, but Ergo itself can achieve privacy of early Monero if there are enough users of the mixers. Actually, it can be far better, as no inference scenarios are possible as described in [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/186.pdf). Related: ErgoMixer 
- **Other**: Ergo offers anyone the ability to issue their own tokens (non-native tokens) on the platform and leverage off its security and decentralization. Advanced on-chain governance is built with miners being able to vote on a number of parameters including simple items like block size – gradual changes only to ensure stability.


Ergo follows a soft-forkability approach --- if an overwhelming majority of the network accepts a new feature, it is activated, however, old nodes which do not upgrade continue to operate normally and just skip over this feature validation. Thus disruptive hard forks should not be required in Ergo.

Ergo mining will always be stable, unlike Bitcoin and other PoW currencies, in which mining may become unstable after the emission period. To achieve survivability, Ergo provides economic improvements in addition to the technical ones, most central of which is a storage fee component which plays an important role for Ergo‘s stability.

## Scalability

The blocks in the Ergo Network are aimed to be produced at an interval of approx. 2 minutes. TPS itself doesn't matter much for Ergo in the long run since it has smart contracts in which you can chain hundreds of transactions within one.  

Ergo’s solutions to transaction congestion are as follows: 

- L0: A lot of efficiency improvements in the node have been completed starting from v4.0.8, 20-50x gains are still possible here. Quick bootstrapping using NiPoPoWs proofs and UTXO set snapshots are also planned

- L1: Ergo has an extension section in its code that allows the implementation of a wide variety of scaling solutions such as Sharding, Hydra, or BitcoinNG-style macroblocks. This even lets us do generic sidechains with velvet or soft forks. 

- L2 (off-chain) - Ergo should be compatible with the Lightning Network, Rainbow Network, and many more. The implementation here will depend on the needs of the applications being built on Ergo.

Ergo has stateless clients, NiPoPoWs - can put full nodes on Raspberry Pi's, make ultra-efficient SPV clients and other means to survive in the long-term even under the load. Storage rent helps to prevent spam & dust and stabilize mining income. Other benefits from having the storage rent fee include prevention of "state bloat", the building of an economy around the state (users must pay to keep unspent boxes in miners' memory for the long‐term) and a gradual return of any lost coins back into circulation.
