## FAQ 
- **What is the teams background?** | Ergo is designed and implemented by a team of experienced developers and researchers, who hold publications and PhDs in cryptography, compiler theory, blockchain technology, and cryptographic e-cash. The team also has a solid background in core development with such cryptocurrencies and blockchain frameworks as Nxt, Scorex and Waves. Alexander 'kushti' Chepurnoy, was a co-founder of smartcontract.com (now Chainlink), a core developer at NXT (first PoS), and one of the first employees at IOHK, where he was a Research Fellow and Team Scorex Manager. The full team can be seen on Ergo's [Hall of Fame](https://ergoplatform.org/en/hall_of_fame/).
- **Why 'Ergo'?** | “Ergo means “therefore” in Latin, but “work” in Greek. Initially, the name was chosen to point to the fact that the design of the cryptocurrency is ERGOnomical.
- **What is the emission schedule?** | [Emission Schedule](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/) with a maximum supply of **97,739,925** Ergs, to be completed in **8 years** after launch. 
- **When was Ergo launched?** | July, 2019. The previous price spike was a different token (Ergo-First-Year-Token), if you view the chart by market-cap it is accurate.
- **Can I stake ERG?** | No, Ergo is a Proof of Work coin - you can however provide liquidity on either the CoinEx AMM pool (watch out for impermanent loss!), or SigmaUSD. However, dApp tokenisation is coming - [A Solution for staking](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-solution-for-staking/1057)

## Ergo Foundation
[What is the Ergo Foundation?](https://ergoplatform.org/en/foundation/)  | The Ergo Foundation is a community-driven entity focused on:

  - Promoting non-breaking development of Ergo Platform protocol;
  - Promoting the widespread adoption and use of Ergo Platform and its native token (ERG);
  - Developing the ecosystem around the Ergo Platform;
  - Promoting the use of Ergo Platform and blockchain technology for social good;
  - Supporting truly decentralized infrastructure, and;
  - Supporting privacy as a basic human right.

>“It's one of the most revolutionary cryptocurrencies ever built. Got so many crazy ideas like sigma protocols and pruning the blockchain and roller chains. All this crazy stuff. Even has a proof of no premine. So really a technological marvel in many respects, and it reflects about 8 years of knowledge that Alex has amassed as both a researcher and a developer. Super concise code and it blows my mind that the market cap is where it's at. It should be a top 10 coin or top 15 coin" — Charles Hoskinson

## Proof of Work

Ergo was created for regular people, PoW allows for a fair start and true decentralistion. It's also widely studied, and has very high-security guarantees - which are essential for having useful contractual, programmable money that's ready today. 

Here's CH talking a bit about [consensus](https://youtu.be/nkr1EKQrVeQ)

- **[Why Proof-of-Work?](https://ergonaut.space/Cardano)** | It's tried and tested (the Lindy effect), and has some advantages over PoS. 



## Features

- [Storage Rent](https://ergonaut.space/en/Autolykos) | After four years, miners can charge fees for unmoved erg. Stabilising miner income and preventing lost coins as we see in BTC. 
- [Sigma Protocols](https://ergonaut.space/en/sigma-protocols) | Ergo’s smart contracts and DeFi functionality are built on Sigma protocols – a powerful, flexible class of zero-knowledge proofs. Find out more about why they’re so important, and how they put Ergo head and shoulders above the competition.
- [eUTxO](https://ergonaut.space/en/eUTXO) | Based on the UTXO model of Bitcoin, similar extended-UTXO model as Cardano, allowing interoperability. 
- [NiPoPoWs](https://ergonaut.space/en/NiPoPoWs) | Verify proof of work without downloading the headers. Enables light-clients during in places with poor internet - and light mining (not having to download the entire chain)
