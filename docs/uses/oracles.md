# Oracles

Oracles are the backbone of a decentralized financial system. It connects off-chain data with the on-chain world. Normally, ETH has no info about the current market price. During a swap order in a decentralized exchange, a swap contract needs to call the data from various data sources to obtain market price. Thus, oracles are the messengers of the crypto ecosystem. Not only in atomic swaps but also in more complex interactions such as lending/borrowing assets or dynamic market-making need the data feeds provided by oracles. DeFi ecosystem suffered from Flash Loan attacks, caused by [misinformation from centralized price oracles](https://insights.glassnode.com/defi-attacks-flash-loans-centralized-price-oracles/).

Ergo developed [Oracle Pools](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-31-ergos-oracle-pools-and-what-they-mean-for-the-ecosystem/) to maintain a robust DeFi ecosystem. Because of the eUTXO design and its rich programming language ErgoScript, oracle networks can be more decentralized. In the extended UTXO model, we have a lot of flexibility and power available to build new protocols. This can be utilized to construct oracle datapoint hierarchies of confidence. In short, they are an abstraction above oracle pools which allows us to scale the benefits of oracle pools as much as we desire, at the cost of price and speed. [ERG/USD oracle pool](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pools-list) is running on Ergo Blockchain.
