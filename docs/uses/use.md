*Everyone is talking about DeFi. Few people are asking what DeFi should look like. Ergo has a vision for what the sector can become.*

2020 is shaping up to be the year in which [Decentralised Finance](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-07-02-ergo-and-the-explosion-of-defi/) rose to mainstream attention, in the same way that Bitcoin and blockchain did in 2016 and 2017. In July alone, Total Value Locked – the amount of funds committed to DeFi dApps’ smart contracts – doubled from $2 billion to $4 billion, largely driven by Compound’s distribution of its COMP governance tokens.

DeFi is all the rage, with several well-known projects pioneering the space before our eyes. But while the crypto world is gripped with the short-term opportunities of DeFi, fewer are talking about what it actually is – and fewer still about what it should be. In building a DeFi platform like Ergo, though, that’s exactly the kind of question we have to ask.

**DeFi dislikes limits**

In talking about what DeFi ‘should’ be, it’s easy to fall into a trap of being prescriptive, of introducing arbitrary conditions and limits. But that’s not what blockchain is about. As we’ve seen with Bitcoin and blockchain more generally, there’s a free market of ideas and nothing is off the table. It’s reasonable (though not particularly helpful) to say that DeFi should be ‘anything and everything’.

Just like blockchain, DeFi brings advantages of transparency, immutability and efficiency (often including speed and/or cost) to financial processes. But in terms of what we believe this new set of technologies should offer, and what decentralised finance can bring to the conventional financial system, it’s worth focusing the conversation on a few other key areas that have been overlooked or under-represented to date: **Privacy, Scalability, Interoperability**, and **Decentralisation**.

### Privacy

As Eric Hughes wrote in [A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) back in 1993, ‘Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.’ That is never more true than for financial privacy. Privacy must be a built-in feature of DeFi – not a bolt on extra or a desirable feature. It must be integral.

But, as Hughes continues, ‘Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.’ There is always a balance to be struck between privacy and compliance, between transparency and anonymity. Large scale adoption of DeFi requires auditability, and the regulatory approval that enables.

Thanks to the latest advances in zero-knowledge proofs, Ergo can offer both privacy and transparency, where required. The platform’s [Sigma Protocols](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_16_ergo_sigma/) offer robust, customisable cryptography – and, at the same time, the ability to selectively reveal information where necessary.

### Scalability

The ability to process thousands of transactions per second is also a non-negotiable feature for a thriving DeFi sector. How this is achieved is less important than that it is achieved; in practice, there will be many different approaches, with different users and protocols selecting the ones they prefer.

For example, while we have seen the rise of sidechains and child chains, the reality is that exchanges remain a gateway to the blockchain world for a large proportion of users. Popular exchanges are increasingly integrating DeFi functionality, allowing their vast user bases to access it from their individual accounts, without interacting directly with the protocol.

While this may be less than ideal from a security perspective, it’s a simple reality that centralised services are not going out of fashion, but are integrating decentralised technologies thanks to the advantages they offer. [Ergo has its own approach to scalability](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-scalability-plan-for-ergo/226), but we can’t and won’t ignore the importance of businesses in driving forward user adoption.

### Interoperability

One of DeFi’s key strengths is composability: the ability to build new applications from existing components, leveraging the network effect of established dApps and tokens. This is one of the main factors that has enabled TVL to explode over the past month.

But composability currently has its limits. Cross-platform composability currently isn’t possible. Even atomic swaps – the first stage of interoperability – are in their infancy, though [Ergo is working on an atomic swap-powered DEX](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_24_atomic_swaps/).

Full interoperability means the ability for a user to execute a smart contract on one platform and have it seamlessly interact with another blockchain. This would allow truly frictionless cross-protocol interaction, and is what is needed to enable the flow of liquidity fully throughout the DeFi world. At that point, applications become blockchain agnostic, and the platforms are really more like the programming languages for accessing dApps’ functionality.

### Decentralisation

Lastly, and specifically in the context of scalability and interoperability, we cannot forget the importance of decentralisation – [something Ergo has always taken seriously](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_12_new_quest/).

Of course DeFi is decentralised – but there are different types of decentralisation. Ethereum, the home of almost every major DeFi dApp, is just one platform.

Ethereum’s developers are working on a plan for scaling, but even if this is successful, it is still one blockchain. Should we entrust all our funds to one network? What if a critical bug or exploit is found?

Interoperability does more than enable cross-chain liquidity. It decentralises the decentralised infrastructure for DeFi, adding layers of redundancy and security. In the process, it strengthens every blockchain that is a part of that ecosystem, creating a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. At a time when relatively large blockchains still suffer double spend attacks and [serious reorgs](https://hackmd.io/@cUBb4hAvQciAEPoU2yfrzQ/Skd4X6MZw), and catastrophic vulnerabilities are found in smart contracts holding tens of millions of dollars of value, we cannot assume that one single blockchain will or should rule them all.

## CDBCs
*As blockchain technology gains traction, central bank digital currencies are among the most significant applications being developed. But these will inevitably fall far short of the ideal, for one simple reason: control. In particular, that has implications for composability and privacy, and much else besides.*

Central bank digital currencies are no longer a theoretical application of blockchain technology. The list of countries developing CBDCs is growing rapidly, with several now trialing state-backed digital cash.

CDBCs are not built on classic, open blockchain technology. While there are various approaches, they are all based on permissioned ledgers that restrict the role of securing the network and processing transactions to a group of approved entities. They also include a control layer that gives administrators the ability to intervene in transactions, blocking or reversing those they deem invalid.

It’s a far cry from the ideals of Bitcoin, and the Ergo platform that aims to build on these. But it’s only to be expected. The state has a role and a remit, and it’s unlikely to give up the control it exercises. Unfortunately, though, there are two ways that holding onto control will mean that CBDCs fall far short of what they could be, meaning they may ultimately cede ground to open platforms like Ergo.

### Composability

As we wrote in a recent blog, composability is a core feature of DeFi. It’s what gives applications network effect, instantly adding value by plugging into existing dapps’ user bases and functionality.

Programmable money is a huge development. The current system is clunky and complicated to use, at best. It’s not possible to attach detailed conditions to transactions, and have them interact seamlessly with software, as can be done with blockchain and smart contracts.

Imagine the value that could be unlocked if CBDCs were programmable, and smart cash could be integrated frictionlessly into new applications – banking interfaces, investment services, stores, social networks, games. The list is endless. But this is hardly likely. The freedom to program money will exist, for many years at least, in the open blockchain space alone.

### Privacy

Secondly, we consider privacy to be a core requirement of DeFi. Money is too important to be used as a tool of surveillance, but there is no question that this is what it will become as soon as the first CBDCs are rolled out to a large user base.

China is one of the furthest ahead in its creation of state-backed digital cash. This is a state that is notorious for its internet censorship and online surveillance of its population. Its human rights record is dire, and in recent days we have learned more about its oppression of the Uighur minority. Moreover, China already uses a social credit system, which grants or denies citizens access to certain services and amenities depending on their social score, with model citizens enjoying greater privileges.

There is, again, no question that a state-backed, traceable CBDC will be used as a tool of surveillance on a scale that is unprecedented in human history. And it will be the same across any nation that implements money within the same framework.

That giant eye on the dollar bill? You ain’t seen nothing yet.

### Private, programmable financial services

Ergo has a very different vision for blockchain-based cash and financial services. In the new paradigm of blockchain, value is not retained by constraining it. It is only maximised through open systems that make it as accessible as people want it to be. Money without borders, in both senses: cash that can be programmed, sent and received freely but privately, between any two individuals or organisations – and even blockchains – anywhere in the world.

This is what money needs to be, and what Ergo is building.


*This is the first in a series of articles speculating on how the fast-emerging DeFi sector might evolve in the coming years.*

The DeFi movement as it currently exists is only a few months old, and blockchain itself has barely existed a decade. Already, though, we are beginning to see themes crystallising and the first popular use cases becoming established.

As a DeFi platform that takes positioning for the future seriously, it’s important that Ergo has a vision – not only a sense of where things might be heading, but the role that it should itself be playing as these new decentralised financial services consolidate and grow in popularity.

While no one can know the future, least of all in this space, a number of trends, technologies, products and use cases are emerging, and it seems that these are starting to plot a certain trajectory. Allowing for necessary course correction as time goes on, where might we see DeFi end up in ten years?

### Tokens will be the fuel for DeFi, and everything will be tokenised

One of the major themes that was becoming apparent, long before the [yield farming craze](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-03-some-thoughts-about-defi-yield-farming-and-how-open-systems-should-be-used/) brought DeFi to global attention, is tokenisation. We already have blockchain tokens representing cryptocurrencies and digital assets, and the first shares and other securities have been issued on the blockchain. The benefits are such that the direction of travel is clear. Sooner or later, everything will end up as tokens.

For regular, fungible (interchangeable) assets, a regular token will work. Fiat and cryptocurrencies, shares, bonds, precious metals, ETFs, [CBDCs](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-17-ergos-vision-for-defi-ergo-vs-cbdcs/) – these will all be freely available on the blockchain.

For other assets, NFTs will proliferate. When you buy a car, house, painting or other unique item of value, whether digital or physical, there’s a good chance that transaction will also include a blockchain token.

These tokenised assets will place on the blockchain trillions of dollars of value that are currently ‘stuck’ offline, illiquid or impossible to buy or sell outside of certain limited circles and circumstances. This pool of tokenised value will represent the fuel of the Defi economy: assets that can be traded frictionlessly, borrowed against and leveraged using decentralised protocols that probably won’t look so very different to the ones we use today.

### Digital identity will become non-negotiable

Since these assets will be tradeable on centralised and decentralised exchanges, digital identity will also become an increasingly important theme. This will link blockchain addresses with offline identities, enabling individuals and corporations to operate in a way that is compliant with relevant regulation. It will also allow the automation of tax and accounting processes. To date, digital identity has been an overlooked element of the DeFi ecosystem – likely due to the use of centralised platforms that can conduct KYC as a condition of use. We’re fast approaching a point where that is no longer a given, with the growth of new forms of decentralised exchange and the increase in volumes moving to these platforms.

### Stablecoins will become embedded elements of the blockchain

One of the biggest use cases for DeFi – and again one that is often overlooked – is stablecoins. These exist in many forms, and rely on a range of approaches: centralised and decentralised, collateralised and algorithmic, fiat-backed, and so on.

Whatever your preferred approach or view of stablecoins, they are here to stay. They have found use cases as a store of value, especially for traders, and as a popular form of collateral for yield farming.

What they haven’t been widely adopted for, yet, is as an integral part of blockchain infrastructure. Transaction fees are almost always paid for with the native blockchain token. Not only does this fluctuate in value, but so does the amount of it required per transaction, depending on both the complexity of the transaction itself and competition for space in the next block. Clearly, this complexity is not conducive to mainstream adoption. End users are best served by simplicity, with minimal burdens for managing multiple tokens. They will want to pay transaction fees in a stable unit of account, and not have to worry about handling the native blockchain token.

The solution? An integrated stablecoin that, to most end users, is the most important token on the platform.

### Two-tier system

As a result of this need, it seems likely that we may start to see a two-tier system evolve more clearly. A blockchain such as Ergo will have a native token, which will serve as the underlying currency of payment, just as occurs now. For the most part, though, these will only be handled by more experienced users. These expert users will maintain the technical and financial infrastructure of the DeFi space. For example, they will mine and use the native token as collateral to create a stablecoin, which can be sold into the market for general use, in return for tokenised assets of all kinds.

Regular users will then use the ‘native stablecoin’ in all their business, as a kind of standard reserve currency. It will be used to buy other assets; it will be lent to users against other tokenised assets as collateral (houses, cars, real estate and much more); and it will be used to pay transaction fees.

The miners who receive this native stablecoin can hold it as it is, to pay for electricity and hardware costs, or they can convert it back to the platform token or other assets – that is up to them.

These are just some of the themes we are starting to see emerging in the DeFi world, and how they might develop over time. In the coming weeks, we’ll explore various other ideas as the space continues to evolve and Ergo launches new technology.


_Ergo enables new models of financial interaction, underpinned by smart contracts built on flexible and powerful Sigma protocols but easily accessible to developers._

One of the most exciting things about blockchain is the possibility of making digital agreements without any trusted intermediaries. In the simplest use case, pioneered by Bitcoin, Alice can send a payment directly to Bob, wherever the two of them are located around the world, with no bank or any trusted third party needed. However, with the functionality of a modern blockchain like Ergo, it is possible to make far more complex and sophisticated financial agreements than simple payments. Take the following example.

## Gold-backed tokens

Alice uses ERGs to purchase gold-backed tokens from Bob. Bob stores the gold in a secure vault, and uses the blockchain to issue one token for every Troy ounce of gold he has. Alice can then use these tokens freely in different contracts, transferring and trading them under whatever conditions she specifies in the smart contract code. When Alice wants to sell the tokens for physical gold, she can conduct another transaction with Bob, receiving ERG in return, at market price.

The point of blockchain contracts is to eliminate the need for trust. While the purchase transaction is now trustless, in this instance Alice still needs to trust Bob about two things. Firstly, Bob may refuse to swap the gold tokens back to ERG at the correct price when Alice wants to sell. Secondly, Bob may default on his obligations – running away with the gold, or misusing the funds he receives and running a fractional reserve.

## Extending the contracts

To address these issues, we can create an Oracle, or decentralised price feed. This uses multiple sources of external data to record the price of gold to the blockchain at regular intervals. This price feed will be the reference point for the redemption contract that manages the sale of Alice’s gold with Bob (or any other participant). Thus the system automatically enforces the right price when a swap takes place.

The second situation requires a third-party insurer, Charlie, whose service is also hosted on the blockchain with a smart contract. When Alice purchases gold from Bob, she additionally buys an insurance contract from Charlie. The payment can be dependent on factors including the amount of insurance required, and Bob’s reputation – again, managed by a decentralized feedback mechanism. Now, if Bob defaults, Alice will automatically receive the value of her gold tokens, with Charlie effectively acting as a buyer of last resort.

## Programmable contracts

There are, of course, many other example use cases like this one. We can also extend this use case, adding further economic actors. For example, Charlie may sell shares in his insurance business to Dave and other participants, providing them with a proportion of revenues in return for ensuring he has the capital he needs to cover any liabilities from the outset.

However, even the most complex use case is simpler than general-purpose software that can be used to program any contract. After all, generalised logic must be both far-reaching and secure. Moreover, even a specialised contract is made up of many steps, each of which is fairly simple. Thus another requirement for a general-purpose platform is that it should simplify the process of writing contracts, making them as accessible (and safe) as possible. This can be achieved with the use of template agreements, with customisable parameters. The insurance contract above could be based on a module with flexible parameters, for example. This could be used and reused in many different circumstances.

## Ergo’s approach

This is essentially the approach that Ergo takes, providing superior support for real-world financial agreements. It does this through:

1. Support for multi-stage contracts ([watch details for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3FlM_WOwBU))
2. A simple high-level language, ErgoScript, enabling clear descriptions of contractual logic
3. Support for formal verification of contracts for improved security guarantees (Ergo Platform deployed its [first formally verified p2p crowdfunding contract](https://twitter.com/chepurnoy/status/1239936086106935296) just three months after the network launched)
4. Easy Oracle creation
5. Native support for complex signature schemes

In short, creating financial contracts on the blockchain isn’t just about the functionality you provide. It’s about making that functionality safe and accessible, as well as powerful. Ergo achieves this and more.


_As the next financial crisis takes hold, it’s clear that conventional monetary policy is at its limit. Smart contract platforms like Ergo enable more innovative, targeted implementations of economic stimulation that the conventional banking sector cannot achieve._

Conventional monetary policy is a hammer. It works as far as it goes, but if all you have is a hammer then every problem starts to look like a nail.

When the Global Financial Crisis hit over a decade ago, central banks did what they were used to doing. Cutting interest rates means it’s cheaper to borrow money, so there’s more cash in the system that can be spent and will circulate in the economy – paying for goods and services, funding employment and allowing life to continue something like as normal.

That, at any rate, is the theory. It’s what central banks do in recessions to stimulate economic activity. When times are better, they raise interest rates to make it more expensive to borrow money and prevent the economy from overheating (including asset bubbles).

## The outer limits

This is a blunt tool, but it works, up to a point. In the 2008 crisis, the problem was more severe – so severe, in fact, that interest rates were slashed to zero. Banks were still afraid to lend because they didn’t know the quality of the collateral they were offered in return, those notorious mortgage-backed securities.

So the central banks undertook a programme of Quantitative Easing (QE). This entailed creating huge amounts of cash that didn’t exist before, then purchasing various assets from the banks. The idea was that the central bank would take on the risk and the assets, and commercial banks would then use this gift of liquidity to lend to small businesses and individuals, allowing them to continue operating as before.

It didn’t work. Little of that newly-created money went to small businesses. Instead, banks used it to shore up their own balance sheets and make their own finances safer, investing only in low-risk assets rather than risky SMEs. Ultimately that cash filtered through to assets like the stock market and property, making the wealthy even more wealthy while the poorer were priced out of the market.

## Helicopter money

Today, as we experience the greatest financial challenge of our lifetimes – greater than even the Global Financial Crisis – central banks are considering even more unorthodox approaches. One of these is ‘helicopter money’. This involves cash being simply airdropped directly to citizens, either in the form of tax breaks or as money straight into their bank accounts. America has discussed giving \$1,200 to every adult. Other nations are exploring the same idea.

But there’s a problem with this, too.

Just like the banks, ordinary citizens are worried about their finances. So instead of going out and spending (where ‘going out’ is even possible), they pay down their debt. That newly-printed money goes nowhere.

That’s really as far as central banks can go. But a platform like Ergo can offer different types of money, with different conditions attached via smart contracts, incentivising different behaviour in different circumstances. And that enables a whole different range of monetary policy tools.

## ‘Hot potato’ money

In normal times, banks seek to maintain an inflation rate of around 2%. This means money is worth less over time. So instead of saving it all, and seeing the value of their savings fall, citizens have the incentive to spend it and circulate it within the economy.

Too much inflation, of course, is a bad thing. Get money printing wrong and you have hyperinflation like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, and your economy collapses.

But what if we kept inflation low, but created a limited amount of a special class of money that had to be used quickly if it was to retain its value at all? We’ll call this ‘hot potato’ money, because it has to be passed on fast.

Using a blockchain and smart contracts, this would be a simple matter of creating a new token that could be freely transferred and traded, just like any other token. And it could be backed by reserves (held with the central bank, commercial banks or any other entity). But the difference would be that it has to be spent within a month of receiving it, or those tokens are locked, their value is lost to the holder and the funds that back them are freed up to return to the reserve holder.

So this would be regular money that people had to spend: use it or lose it. If they hoard it, it becomes useless. And we can ensure that it is not used to pay down debt by including conditions that ensure it cannot be used by the banking sector. Of course, Ergo’s Sigma protocols can be used to figure out what has been spent, where, without knowing individual spending habits – enabling even more targeted stimulus.

This idea likely has far-reaching implications – and possibly unintended consequences. What would the result be, for example, of creating different ‘classes’ of money that were only semi-interchangeable? Would this introduce unwelcome, even dangerous friction?

This and other questions would need to be explored further. What’s clear is that central banks are already experimenting with unconventional monetary policy and are fast reaching the end of the road. We can continue that experiment with better, more powerful and targeted tools.



## Powerful But Safe Contracts

Ethereum is an exceptional platform, but there are things it does not do well. Its Turing-complete smart contracts are powerful, but dangerous – as incidents from The DAO to the Parity wallet exploits have proven, with tens of millions of dollars in collateral damage. With complexity comes uncertainty, and potentially catastrophic vulnerabilities. Contracts can be expensive to run, and depending on network conditions may execute unpredictably – or not at all. 

Ergo takes a fundamentally different approach to smart contract development. The team, which has extensive experience with blockchain platforms, frameworks and organisations from Nxt and Waves to Scorex and IOHK, has adopted a declarative model for programming whereby it’s always known in advance how much code will cost to run – and, indeed, whether it will run precisely as intended. While that might on the surface limit code complexity, it’s nevertheless possible to create Turing-complete scripts by iterating processes across multiple blocks. That means Ergo can support versatile dApps that run predictably, with known costs, and don’t have any of the dangers of unrestricted functionality.

## Sigma protocols

The platform is unashamedly conservative, basing as many features as possible on Bitcoin – after all, Bitcoin is the most battle-tested crypto network in existence. Ergo’s UTXO model, PoW mining and finite supply draw on Bitcoin’s approaches to consensus and economic incentives.

But Ergo also incorporates cutting-edge research into new cryptographic processes, using Sigma protocols to enable DeFi applications that would be either complex and messy or simply impossible on other platforms. Sigma protocols are a well-known class of zero-knowledge proofs that allow developers to implement very powerful processes very elegantly. For example, what if you want to build a privacy service that allows any one of a dozen different accounts to spend funds from an address – but no one can tell who has made each transfer? Such a ‘ring contract’ is possible with Ethereum, but it would require a clunky and expensive workaround. With Ergo’s Sigma protocols, it’s possible to implement this kind of use case and many others quickly, efficiently and – above all – securely. Sigma protocols have not been deployed in such generic form within crypto before. Yet this kind of out-of-the-box functionality is hugely valuable, especially when no other DeFi platform offers it.

_Ergo enables new models of financial interaction, underpinned by smart contracts built on flexible and powerful Sigma protocols but easily accessible to developers._

One of the most exciting things about blockchain is the possibility of making digital agreements without any trusted intermediaries. In the simplest use case, pioneered by Bitcoin, Alice can send a payment directly to Bob, wherever the two of them are located around the world, with no bank or any trusted third party needed.

4. Easy Oracle creation
5. Native support for complex signature schemes

In short, creating financial contracts on the blockchain isn’t just about the functionality you provide. It’s about making that functionality safe and accessible, as well as powerful. Ergo achieves this and more.

DeFi dApps have overloaded the Ethereum blockchain, causing long delays and soaring fees for transactions. Ethereum and many other platforms besides have researched and implemented fixes to address the lack of capacity. However, all of the solutions are imperfect in one way or another. Larger blocks are the obvious but clumsy fix, resulting in centralisation as fewer miners can afford the bandwidth, storage and CPU cycles to participate. Reducing the number of block validators – another approach taken to increase throughput – also necessarily centralises the blockchain. Sharding, while potentially very promising, has yet to be implemented successfully, and in some proposed implementations, breaks atomic composability because shards cannot communicate seamlessly.

Thus many of the ways projects seek to ensure their blockchains are fit for purpose result in greater centralisation or loss of critical functionality. 

**Marginal gains**

Ergo’s developers are watching developments in the DeFi space closely, especially some of the proposals that aim to scale blockchains while maintaining security, decentralisation and atomic composability. In the meantime, there is much that can be done to improve blockchain capacity. The concept of ‘marginal gains’, often applied in sports, is useful: a number of small, incremental gains in different areas all add up to a substantial compound effect.

For Ergo, there are several design principles and choices that have been taken to realise efficiencies in different areas.

* [Storage rent](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_21_ergo_positioning/) is akin to ‘on-chain garbage collection’, reducing blockchain bloat and lowering the long-term costs of mining, improving economic sustainability.
* NiPoPoWs (non-interactive proof-of-proof-of-works) enable [mobile SPV clients](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_05_1_spv_security/) and [even lite full nodes](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_05_08_lite_full_nodes/), again reducing the barriers to maintaining the network and improving decentralisation.
* A [smart contract language](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf) that is finite and clear, without the messiness and possible chain bloat of Turing-complete languages and their unintended consequences.
* [Sigma Protocols](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_16_ergo_sigma/), which allow for powerful cryptographic use cases, implemented elegantly and efficiently.

As DeFi emerges as a major use case for blockchain, the stakes could not be higher. Blockchains that are fit for purpose will thrive; those that do not allow the functionality to sustain the required transaction load simply cannot establish a foothold. At the same time moving too fast and implementing untested technology is equally dangerous. 

There are efficiencies to be gained in first-generation blockchains. Ergo continues to prioritise this approach while researching future upgrades.

#### Ergo Blockchain is Layer 1 Protocol for powerful Decentralized Finance Contracts that builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. The Proof of Work consensus algorithm and underlying UTxO model enable robust scalability and security. Ergo is also partnered with [EMURGO](https://emurgo.io/) , the commercial arm of Cardano, to improve research on blockchain and zero-knowledge ecosystems. To check out some smart contract deployments, see our GitHub repositories [here](https://github.com/ergoplatform) and [here](https://github.com/Emurgo).

## Stablecoin

Blockchain assets can be extremely volatile. That’s why investors often seek digital assets which are pegged to national currencies. A Stablecoin is the most primitive integration of cryptocurrencies with the off-chain world. Until DAI, fiat custody services were provided by centralized services. The first example of a stable coin, USDT, is backed by [actual dollars](https://cryptobriefing.com/external-auditor-first-confirm-tethers-usdt-backing/) held in banks. However, for a decentralized financial system, we need other means of fiat-pegged currencies. 

Launched in February, Ergo’s native stablecoin SigUSD is based on AgeUSD protocol to provide a robust Reserve/Mint contract. Providing a truly decentralized finance experience. It’s collateralized with its own native cryptocurrency reserves ERG using SigRSV as the trust component which gives SigUSD’s $1 value. SigRSV collateral ratio is set to a minimum of a 400% ratio with SigUSD. This design prohibits liquidations such as we saw in [2020 March crash](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/black-thursday-response-thread/1433). As Emurgo states, "Black Thursday," when MakerDAO CDPs were triggered for liquidation due to volatility and then sold for $0 due to blockchain congestion that prevented others from bidding, demonstrated that a new design is needed. For SigmaUSD, this scenario is not possible.

## Oracle

Oracles are the backbone of a decentralized financial system. It connects off-chain data with the on-chain world. Normally, ETH has no info about the current market price. During a swap order in a decentralized exchange, a swap contract needs to call the data from various data sources to obtain market price. Thus, oracles are the messengers of the crypto ecosystem. Not only in atomic swaps but also in more complex interactions such as lending/borrowing assets or dynamic market-making need the data feeds provided by oracles. DeFi ecosystem suffered from Flash Loan attacks, caused by [misinformation from centralized price oracles](https://insights.glassnode.com/defi-attacks-flash-loans-centralized-price-oracles/).

Ergo developed [Oracle Pools](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-31-ergos-oracle-pools-and-what-they-mean-for-the-ecosystem/) to maintain a robust DeFi ecosystem. Because of the eUTXO design and its rich programming language ErgoScript, oracle networks can be more decentralized. In the extended UTXO model, we have a lot of flexibility and power available to build new protocols. This can be utilized to construct oracle datapoint hierarchies of confidence. In short, they are an abstraction above oracle pools which allows us to scale the benefits of oracle pools as much as we desire, at the cost of price and speed. [ERG/USD oracle pool](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pools-list) is running on Ergo Blockchain.

## NFT

Blockchains aren’t only about cryptocurrencies. Audio or visual artworks can also be deployed on immutable smart contracts of blockchains. These artworks are represented by [Non-Fungible Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token). Furthermore, artworks can be traded in decentralized auction houses. This would help artists to reach the world without any restriction of governments or without any need for centralized licensing firms. It means the democratization of art markets with the help of public blockchain.

Some examples like [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) or [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) are auction markets running on Ethereum Network. Any artist can create and sell their artwork in there, however, gas prices to mint an NFT can take up to $100. Ergo’s scalable and faster design would reduce the gas costs to almost zero, without giving up security or speed. [Ergo NFT Auctionhouse](https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=picture) is open for months and it allows listings for a picture, audio, or any other kind of non-fungible tokens.

## DEX

Until 2020 DeFi Summer, Value Locked in DeFi ([TVL](https://medium.com/coinmonks/google-sheets-analytics-total-value-locked-in-defi-33b926c18a9f)) was too low to use the platforms effectively. After an increasing interest and new token issuance every day, Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) came into the sunlight. Their benefits are for people who don’t want to give up the custody of their funds. DEXes democratized the exchange experience for both blockchain developers and crypto investors. 

[ErgoDEX](https://ergonaut.space/ergodex.pdf) can provide more functions than Ethereum based DEXes. ErgoDEX [has more properties](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-06-ergodex-model-amm-and-order-book-type-exchange/) such as limit orders, partial filling, and buy-back supports. Ergo’s Multi-Stage Contracts allows for timed release payments, so a code implemented in the contract can help investors to cancel their order with a minimal loss if the developers of the project don’t deliver their promises. With the implementation of NIPoPoWS, DEX will be interoperable in both PoS and PoW blockchains. Users can enjoy the freedom of exchanges with self-custodial wallets.

## DAO

DAO stands for [Decentral Autonomous Organizations](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/). Cryptocurrencies are decentralized (not all of them!), and so their platforms. The governance of these platforms is run by decentralized entities. Every decision is made by pseudo-anonym individuals of DeFi platforms for prohibiting the centralization of power. Therefore, certain tokens are used for voting or making enhancements to these DeFi platforms. [New coin issuances](https://wbtc.network/), redefinition of purposes etc. are all very vital features and can’t be left to a small group of individuals if the crypto ecosystem is for the masses. [Zero-Knowledge Treasury Vaults](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-04-announcing-the-zk-treasury-on-ergo/) with multi-key signature are the first example of a DAO in Ergo Blockchain.

## Lending - Borrowing

Lending and borrowing are two components that increase liquidity flow in financial systems. For example, you have Bitcoins but you want to leverage your holding without selling your BTC. So, you can stake your BTC (you can also use your house as collateral in this sense) as collateral to borrow SigUSD and use it in exchanges or yield farming protocols. On the other side of your interaction, another user can leverage her unused SigUSD by staking in the lending protocol. Traditional banks have very low-interest rates and they might suck up a lot of revenue from your deposits. With decentral lending protocols such as [Compound](https://compound.finance/), users will be able to use lend/borrow services and move their funds across all crypto ecosystems without any need for centralized platforms such as banks or exchanges. Crypto lending protocols are open to more experimental designs such as [interest-free loans](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/interest-free-loan-contract/67), innovating even more use cases on blockchains.

## Derivatives

Besides buying and selling the tokens of a protocol, traders also want to monetize via various strategies such as options or leveraged future contracts. In traditional finance, these tools are provided by brokerage firms and in the crypto world by centralized exchanges. However, this can turn out to be very harmful towards traders by making exchanges big casinos who can see the player’s hands. That’s why in decentralized finance, there is also an alternative as options or derivatives trading smart contract platform. [Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) is an example of leveraged assets trading platform. The platform token creates liquidity for the traders who want to take leveraged positions. [Hegic](https://www.hegic.co/) on the other hand provides an options trading platform for traders who wants to bet on call-put options via smart contracts. These are just two examples of derivatives protocols on Ethereum. Ergo Blockchain’s Multi-Stage Contracts can also provide these protocols on top of it.

## Insurance

Another big sector of the finance industry is Insurance. Every exchangeable asset carries a risk of losing it, whether by unprecedented risks such as taking a bullet to your Ledger Wallet or foreseeable risks such as [rug pulls](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/rug-pulled). New protocols emerged such as [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io/) to tackle the decentral insurance problem. If you think about insurance, it pays a premium to risk bearers in case a bad event happens, exchanging your money for security. In a Decentralized Insurance platform: Your participation, risk bearers’ participation and validation of the trade by oracles can all be governed by smart contracts to create a smoothly functioning DeFi ecosystem.

## Yield Aggregation

So after an expansion of new decentralized exchanges such as [Bancor](https://bancor.network/), [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Sushiswap](https://www.sushi.com/), and [Curve](https://resources.curve.fi/), people are started to look for easier ways to move capital around those exchanges to create the best yields. Yield Aggregators are helping users to automate the liquidity farming actions. The first example of a yield aggregation protocol is [Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance/). In the protocol, users can choose different yield farming strategies among the vaults deployed. Not only users but also developers can leverage yield farming platforms by creating their unique yield farming strategies and deploying them on protocols. Such examples will be very useful for market-making algorithms in the future by supporting deep liquidity all across DeFi.

## Index Coins

Not all crypto investors are conscient about different blockchain use cases. Some of the investors may want to benefit from indexed tokens to invest in various cryptocurrencies. For such an innovation dynamic market-making(DMM) algorithms would be necessary to adjust the funds after price changes. Besides, people who will release index tokens must have the market knowledge to decide which tokens must be involved in the indexed and for how many percentage. Some examples of index coins running on Ethereum are ASSY, YETI, PIPT, YLA issued by [Powerpool Protocol](https://powerpool.finance/). 

## Asset Tokenization

Asset Tokenization is meeting traditional financial assets with crypto. A centralized exchange [FTX](https://ftx.com/markets/stocks) provides US stocks in exchange for cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon, however, is very new due to regulation problems. Stock tokens are not yet traded on decentralized exchanges. Another example of tokenization of real-world assets would be real estate tokenization. With the help of cryptocurrencies, [houses can be fractionated](https://labsgroup.io/) into thousands of tokens representing real estate. These kinds of implementations will help retail investors to invest in houses all around the world with minimal savings.

*All the utilities of traditional banks are becoming decentralized applications on smart contract platforms. Ergo is providing robust and rich infrastructure with **ErgoScript** language to support a complex DeFi ecosystem powered by **Multi-Stage Contracts**.*

<!--EndFragment-->## Why Ergo

Ergo is the inevitable next step in the evolution of Proof of Work blockchain technology, designed for
creating and implementing powerful, efficient and highly secure financial contracts. It is an open-source,
decentralized network that builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on
the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. It complements tried
and tested principles with the latest peer-reviewed academic research into cryptography, consensus
models, and digital currencies.

## Evolution of Ergo

Ergo’s native language, Ergoscript, was created by Alex Chepurnoy, the primary developer of Ergo.
Before his work and research with Ergo, Chepurnoy was an IOHK research fellow and served as the
project manager of Scorex where he helped design and build its modular blockchain framework. As a
core developer of NXT, Chepurnoy was integral in the development of its pure Proof of Stake
cryptocurrency, the first of its kind. The work on color coins at NXT was instrumental in developing the
necessary foundations for creating advanced markets operating on a blockchain.

## Ergoscript - Unlocking Financial Empowerment

Ergoscript’s language is founded on the use of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, or Σ-protocols
(Sigma Protocols). It is a Scala-based language and therefore benefits from the stateless framework
which allows for formal verification on contract logic, granting developers and programmers the ability to
create smart contracts with features such as ring-signatures, multisignatures, multiple currencies,
self-replicating scripts, anti-theft features, and enhanced security.

Ergoscript truly increases the creative potential of blockchain technology and allows for an incredible
variety of DeFi products and financial services. To further explore the intrinsic properties of Ergo’s
Σ-protocols, please see [Whitepaper II](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf) and [Whitepaper III](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/AdvancedErgoScriptTutorial.pdf) on the Ergo Platform website.

## A Commitment to Continued Open Source Community-Based Work and Collaboration

Community is integral to the identity of Ergo while it continues to build financial frameworks that benefit everyday users. The cryptocurrency industry would not exist if not for decades of collaboration between technologists, scientists and mathematicians. Ergo continues the spirit of collaboration for the benefit of humanity by providing tools to disintermediate power and give it to the people. This is paramount to Alex Chepurnoy’s life work. [The Ergo Manifesto](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion on Chepurnoy’s inspiration for Ergo.

> Cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich ordinary people. Their small businesses
> providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital. This
> is what inspired me. This is my dream.
>
> I hope Ergo will be useful here. Thousands of small cooperatives and individual
> entrepreneurs are more important to healthy and sustainable wealth growth around the
> globe than a couple of corporations hiding profits in offshore heavens.

Chepurnoy works directly with a team of 15 developers, some of whom oversee and manage
development teams. Ergo’s growing environment strives to maintain a strong synergy between
developers, the Ergo Foundation, and other community contributors with the goal of creating high-quality
dApps that provide a rich user experience.

## Ergo Ecosystem

The user experience includes the [NFT Auction House](https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=picture), a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin protocol,
[SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io/#/), secure and efficient [Oracle Pools](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pool-state/ergusd), and increased financial privacy with [ErgoMixer](https://github.com/ergoMixer/ergoMixBack). Users will
soon be able to access the non-custodial, decentralized exchange, [ErgoDex](https://ergodex.io/), and its ability to provide
efficient and secure transactions between the Ergo and Cardano blockchains. The Proof of Work
consensus algorithm and underlying extended UTxO model empowers Ergo to always offer scalable and
secure solutions. There are several other exciting projects in the works such as ErgoFund, LETS,
Ergo.Meta --- and more community made dApps are starting to appear on the back of the Hackathon.

## Ergo Partnerships

Ergo is proud to partner with EMURGO, the commercial arm of Cardano, in improving research on
blockchain and zero-knowledge ecosystems. The upcoming integration with Waves Network will also see
Ergo implement cross-chain functionality with all Waves enabled blockchains. Additionally, Ergo continues
to support the security and protection of individuals in the crypto space as a member of the blockchain alliance, BPSAA.
