## Stablecoins

Blockchain assets can be extremely volatile. That’s why investors often seek digital assets which are pegged to national currencies. A Stablecoin is the most primitive integration of cryptocurrencies with the off-chain world. Until DAI, fiat custody services were provided by centralized services. The first example of a stable coin, USDT, is backed by [actual dollars](https://cryptobriefing.com/external-auditor-first-confirm-tethers-usdt-backing/) held in banks. However, for a decentralized financial system, we need other means of fiat-pegged currencies. 

Launched in February, Ergo’s native stablecoin SigUSD is based on AgeUSD protocol to provide a robust Reserve/Mint contract. Providing a truly decentralized finance experience. It’s collateralized with its own native cryptocurrency reserves ERG using SigRSV as the trust component which gives SigUSD’s $1 value. SigRSV collateral ratio is set to a minimum of a 400% ratio with SigUSD. This design prohibits liquidations such as we saw in [2020 March crash](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/black-thursday-response-thread/1433). As Emurgo states, "Black Thursday," when MakerDAO CDPs were triggered for liquidation due to volatility and then sold for $0 due to blockchain congestion that prevented others from bidding, demonstrated that a new design is needed. For SigmaUSD, this scenario is not possible.
