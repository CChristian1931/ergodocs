# Asset Tokenization

Asset Tokenization is meeting traditional financial assets with crypto. A centralized exchange [FTX](https://ftx.com/markets/stocks) provides US stocks in exchange for cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon, however, is very new due to regulation problems. Stock tokens are not yet traded on decentralized exchanges. Another example of tokenization of real-world assets would be real estate tokenization. With the help of cryptocurrencies, [houses can be fractionated](https://labsgroup.io/) into thousands of tokens representing real estate. These kinds of implementations will help retail investors to invest in houses all around the world with minimal savings.
