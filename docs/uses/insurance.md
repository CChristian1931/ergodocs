## Insurance

Another big sector of the finance industry is Insurance. Every exchangeable asset carries a risk of losing it, whether by unprecedented risks such as taking a bullet to your Ledger Wallet or foreseeable risks such as [rug pulls](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/rug-pulled). New protocols emerged such as [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io/) to tackle the decentral insurance problem. If you think about insurance, it pays a premium to risk bearers in case a bad event happens, exchanging your money for security. In a Decentralized Insurance platform: Your participation, risk bearersâ€™ participation and validation of the trade by oracles can all be governed by smart contracts to create a smoothly functioning DeFi ecosystem.
