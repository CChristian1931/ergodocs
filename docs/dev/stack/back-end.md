# Back-end

This page provides an overview of the tools used to interact with the Ergo blockchain. Developers can use these tools to read data from the blockchain, compute using that data and optionally create transactions to be broadcast. Each tool requires the developer to "program" in some language.

Users of AppKit will usually write Scala code (although AppKit supports many other languages). HDF users will need to write Rust code. JDE users will have to write JSON.
