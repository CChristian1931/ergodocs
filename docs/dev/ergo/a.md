Ergo is already using epoch length of ~1.5 days (with normal block rate), not Bitcoin's 2 weeks. However, more epochs considered, but retargeting function is non-linear also, so may adjust sooner than linear function in certain popular scenarios.

 coin hopping was one of the motivations there
Our algo will adjust slowly yes, but it is also preventing from adversarial hopping.
