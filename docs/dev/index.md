# Developers

There are several pathways to start developing on Ergo. A typical dApp is usually composed of a [**Front-end**](stack/front-end/) user-interface built in your framework of choice, a [**Backend**](stack/back-end) where we can perform logic off-chain, and finally, the [**Smart Contract**](scs/) component where the magic happens, the on-chain validation of the off-chain logic.

## ErgoPad-QuickStart

ErgoPad has [released a set of docker containers](https://github.com/ergo-pad/ergopad) combined to create a React/MaterialUI frontend, REST API backend, assembler to interact with smart contracts and supporting services like ergonode, redis and postgres.

## DeCo

Over eight weeks, participants will learn about extended UTXO and boxes, registers, ErgoScript, designing simple systems, multi-transaction systems, and much more. According to their Reddit post, the ErgoLearn (DeCo) course aims to empower individuals with the following skills:

1. Explain basic eUTXOs concepts

2. Design basic Financial Systems on Ergo

3. Interact with Ergo Smart Contract developers

4. Navigate through basic ErgoScript‚Äù

Creating and deploying a curriculum takes considerable time and resources and the team behind the project were successfully funded through a fundraiser hosted on [Ergo Raffle: ErgoLearn (DeCo) Funding](https://ergoraffle.com/raffle/show/d6941cb138ff2442d42a9636b8acf1ac06e2ca0665a884030e69499f0a2b139d).
