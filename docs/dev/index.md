# Developers

This page should provide an entry-point to every section of Ergo development. For a high-level introduction to Ergo please see the [protocol page](/dev/protocol)

## Architecture 

Apps in the Ergo ecosystem looks a bit like this.

Your application will communicate with the blockchain via a locally run instance of the Ergo Node. The Node provides an API that is used by your SDK logic to carry out operations on the blockchain.
