# Developers

There are several pathways to start developing on Ergo. A typical dApp is usually composed of a [**Front-end**](stack/front-end/) user-interface built in your framework of choice, a [**Backend**](stack/back-end) where we can perform logic off-chain, and finally, the [**Smart Contract**](scs/) component where the magic happens, the on-chain validation of the off-chain logic.
