# Developers

Developing Apps in the Ergo ecosystem looks a bit like this.

Your application will communicate with the blockchain via a local run instance of the Ergo Node. An Ergo Node provides an API that is used by the SDK logic to carry out operations on the blockchain.


## Getting Started

A typical dApp is usually composed of a [**Front-end**](stack/front-end/) user-interface built in your framework of choice, a [**Backend**](stack/back-end) where we can perform logic off-chain, and finally, the [**Smart Contract**](scs/) component where the magic happens, the on-chain validation of the off-chain logic.


### Prerequisite 

- [Set up a local Node](/node/)
- [Using the TestNet](/dev/start/testnet)
- [Remote Nodes](/node/remote)

## Languages

- [Start coding in Scala](/dev/Languages/scala)
- [Start coding in Java](/dev/Languages/java)
- [Start coding in Rust](/dev/Languages/rust)
- [Start coding in Python](/dev/Languages/python)

## DeCo

Over eight weeks, participants will learn about extended UTXO and boxes, registers, ErgoScript, designing simple systems, multi-transaction systems, and much more. According to their Reddit post, the ErgoLearn (DeCo) course aims to empower individuals with the following skills:

1. Explain basic eUTXOs concepts

2. Design basic Financial Systems on Ergo

3. Interact with Ergo Smart Contract developers

4. Navigate through basic ErgoScript‚Äù

Creating and deploying a curriculum takes considerable time and resources and the team behind the project were successfully funded through a fundraiser hosted on [Ergo Raffle: ErgoLearn (DeCo) Funding](https://ergoraffle.com/raffle/show/d6941cb138ff2442d42a9636b8acf1ac06e2ca0665a884030e69499f0a2b139d).
