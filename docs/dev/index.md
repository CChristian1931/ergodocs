# Developers

This page should provide an entry-point to every section of Ergo development. For a high-level introduction to Ergo please see the [protocol page](/dev/protocol)

## Architecture 

Apps in the Ergo ecosystem looks a bit like this.

Your application will communicate with the blockchain via a locally run instance of the Ergo Node. The Node provides an API that is used by your SDK logic to carry out operations on the blockchain.

- [Set up a local Node](/node/)



## Libraries

- [Back-end libraries (SDKs)](stack/back-end)
- [Front-end libraries](stack/front-end/)

## Languages


- [Start coding in JVM (Scala/Java)](/dev/stack/appkit/)
