# Where to start?

A typical dApp ontop Ergo has the following structure.

- [**Front-end**](../lib/front-end.md) | The user-interface built in your framework of choice.
- **REST** | A *REST*ful API to interact with the backend
- [**Backend**](../lib/back-end.md) | Performs the off-chain logic
- [**Contract**](#ergoscript) | Where the magic happens, the on-chain validation of the off-chain logic.
