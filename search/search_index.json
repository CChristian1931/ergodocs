Unspent outputs are single-use entities. However, Ergo is built from scratch; thus, scripts and transaction formats are different. like in Bitcoin, there are some standard scripts in Ergo associated with addresses, e.g. P2PK addresses. There's an article on address schemes available here Ergo has an inbuilt wallet API which is enough for most use-cases. API has a Swagger interface (on 127.0.0.1:9053 by default in the mainnet, 127.0.0.1:9052 in the testnet) with descriptions and examples for API methods. How to set up a node: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_02_how_to_setup/, https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node Please run the node with -Xmx3G flag, e.g. java -jar -Xmx3G ergo-4.0.4.jar --mainnet -c mainnet.conf Node Wallet Node wallet has UI available @ 127.0.0.1:9053/panel by default on the mainnet (127.0.0.1:9052/panel on the testnet). Main methods: /wallet/init and /wallet/restore to create a wallet (and a secret mnemonic) and restore wallet from mnemonic /wallet/unlock to unlock the wallet (it is unlocked after init but locked after restart) /wallet/lock to lock the wallet /wallet/payment/send to send a simple payment /wallet/status to get wallet status /wallet/deriveNextKey to derive a new key according to EIP-3 (BIP 44 implementation for Ergo) /wallet/balances to get wallet balance (for all the addresses) /wallet/transactions to get wallet transactions (for all the addresses) Create an external wallet. If you are going to perform your wallet logic externally, you can do so with a library and the block explorer. Please note, you need to consider mempool transactions to avoid double-spending generation .

We call this object a box. A box is an immutable object which can be only created or removed. A box is not simply a coin; it contains registers with data (and code). Even more, there's nothing inbox but registers. There are four predefined registers, with monetary value, protecting script, and identifier of a transaction which created the box and output index in the transaction (and creation height). Because data of transaction which created the box is included in it, the box has unique contents and, therefore, a unique id. A box is a first-class citizen in the Ergo protocol. Active boxes set is authenticated via a hash-based data structure, which allows building lightweight full-nodes (as described in this paper ). A box may have up to six additional registers with typed data. A script may access its registers (as well as registers of input and output boxes of the spending transaction). Example of a box (proof-of-no-premine from Ergo genesis state, which contains last block ids from Bitcoin and Ethereum at the moment of launch, and also latest news headlines): { \"boxId\": \"b8ce8cfe331e5eadfb0783bdc375c94413433f65e1e45857d71550d42e4d83bd\", \"value\": 1000000000, \"ergoTree\": \"10010100d17300\", \"assets\": [], \"creationHeight\": 0, \"additionalRegisters\": { \"R5\": \"0e42307864303761393732393334363864393133326335613261646162326535326132333030396536373938363038653437623064323632336337653365393233343633\", \"R6\": \"0e464272657869743a20626f746820546f727920736964657320706c617920646f776e207269736b206f66206e6f2d6465616c20616674657220627573696e65737320616c61726d\", \"R8\": \"0e45d094d0b8d0b2d0b8d0b4d0b5d0bdd0b4d18b20d0a7d0a2d09fd09720d0b2d18bd180d0b0d181d182d183d18220d0bdd0b02033332520d0bdd0b020d0b0d0bad186d0b8d18e\", \"R7\": \"0e54e8bfb0e8af84efbc9ae5b9b3e8a1a1e38081e68c81e7bbade38081e58c85e5aeb9e28094e28094e696b0e697b6e4bba3e5ba94e5afb9e585a8e79083e58c96e68c91e68898e79a84e4b8ade59bbde4b98be98193\", \"R4\": \"0e4030303030303030303030303030303030303031346332653265376533336435316165376536366636636362363934326333343337313237623336633333373437\" } } A box, at the minimum, has four pieces of information. The value in NanoErgs ( 1 Erg = 1000000000 NanoErgs ). The guard script (like scriptPubKey of Bitcoin). This is also called the \"smart contract.\" Additional assets (tokens) are stored in this box. Creation info of the box ( txId , the identifier of the transaction that created the box along with an output index). It also contains a maxCreation height parameter defined by the box creator (this is not the creation height; its use is to create \"payment channels easily\"). R0 = monetary value R1 = protecting script R2 = tokens <\u2014 this was missed R3 = identifier of a transaction which created the box and output index in the transaction (and also creation height). These are stored in the first four registers (numbered R0-R3) of the box. In addition, a box can have six optional registers (R4-R9) to store custom data for use in smart contracts. Registers must be densely packed; that is, we cannot sandwich empty registers between non-empty ones. The optional registers can contain data of any of the following types: Int , Long with the usual semantics of Scala. BigInt is a 256-bit integer (i.e., all computation is done modulo 2^256). GroupElement , a point on the Secp256k1 curve represented in compressed format. Coll[Byte] , a collection of bytes, semantically similar to Array[Byte] in Scala. Collection of the above, i.e., Coll[Int] , Coll[GroupElement] , Coll[Coll[Byte]] , etc. A boxId is calculated based on the contents of all the registers. This boxId uniquely defines a box and can be considered equivalent to Bitcoin's (txId, vOut) pairs. Note that Ergo txId depends only on the message and not on signatures (similar to Bitcoin SegWit transactions). Hence, a txId is available even before signing. Similar to Bitcoin, Ergo supports chained transactions (i.e., spending of boxes with 0 confirmations).","title":"Box"},{"location":"dev/data-model/p2p-handshake/","text":"Handshaking To establish a connection with another peer, a handshake messages exchange is needed in the first place.

Thus, the SELF.R4[Int] expression should evaluate a valid value of the Option[Int] type. For example, val x = SELF.R4[Int] expects the register, if it is present, to have type Int . There are three cases: 1) If the register doesn't exist. Then val x = SELF.R4[Int] succeeds and returns the None value, which conforms to any value of type Option[T] for any T. (In the example above, T is equal to Int ). Calling x.get fails when x is equal to None, but x.isDefined succeeds and returns false . 2) If the register contains a value v of type Int . Then val x = SELF.R4[Int] succeeds and returns Some(v) , which is a valid value of type Option[Int] . In this case, calling x.get succeeds and returns the value v of type Int . Calling x.isDefined returns true . 3) If the register contains a value v of type T other than Int . Then val x = SELF.R4[Int] fails because there is no way to return a valid value of type Option[Int] .

It provides superior: Privacy, as UTXOs are one-time objects making it possible to formalise privacy leaks. Scalability, as parallel transaction processing is more straightforward in UTXO. UTXOs are also more friendly to known stateless client solutions. Interoperability, as off-chain and sidechain protocols. One-time objects are more straightforward to work with from an off-chain point of view. Transaction Cost Predictability, where the only on-chain action is validating the smart contracts. As a result, the transaction cost is significantly lower, and most importantly, the transaction cost is predictable, eliminating the need for \u2018gas.\u2019 ErgoScript is built considering Bitcoin\u2019s security and privacy and the purpose of making all kinds of complex financial contracts accessible to everyone. However, Bitcoin\u2019s design doesn\u2019t allow loops, and building complex smart contracts on top of it aren\u2019t possible. ErgoScript allows for self-replication; therefore, we can use it to create Turing-Complete processes in a blockchain. Another approach to creating smart contracts in the blockchain is the Account-Based model, like on Ethereum. Ethereum\u2019s design facilitates smart contract opeld coins, so the unspent transaction output (UTXO) show us which private key holds which coiration by processing smart contracts as accounts. In Bitcoin, there aren\u2019t accounts that hons. Coins are in a set of addresses represented with a single UTXO. It\u2019s also easier to include privacy schemes in this model than the Account-Based model. Therefore, Ergo developed Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO model to the extended UTXO model by introducing a readable UTXO design. This enables smart contracts to use UTXOs as data inputs without changing them. Therefore nodes are checking transactions rather than balances. In comparison, in Ethereum\u2019s Account model, nodes check all accounts to validate the system. Side by side, the UTXO model is more scalable, but it\u2019s also more complicated to build User Interface tools. The account model provides easier access to developers, but codes are heavier on the blockchain, leading to network congestion. Furthermore, UTXO allows for parallel computation, and it\u2019s easier to compute atomic swaps in a non-custodial manner. https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-10-04-off-chain-logic-and-eutxo/ https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-09-26-the-utxo-alliance/ Ergo takes the most secure and well-established features of Bitcoin and implements advanced new cryptographic features on its rock-solid foundations. This series explores our choices in creating Ergo, with the first article unpacking the advantages of the UTXO model. When you\u2019re dealing with financial value, you cannot afford to take chances. Every architecture decision in a cryptocurrency platform has implications. While there are different ways to solve the same problem, some solutions are better tested and more reliable. Like Bitcoin, Ergo uses the \u2018UTXO\u2019 (unspent transaction outputs) model rather than the Account model used by platforms like Ethereum. There are several reasons why we have made this choice, but first, it\u2019s worth explaining a little about how the UTXO or \u2018Box\u2019 model works. Most people think that the balance of an account is a simple number that is updated when you send or receive funds. This is the obvious way to approach the problem; it is effectively how money works in the real world. Your bank account has a balance that is increased or decreased when different transfers are made in and out. This is how the \u2018Account\u2019 model operates: your balance on the blockchain is altered by transactions to and from the account. How much dough? The UTXO model, pioneered by Bitcoin, is quite different. You can think of this a bit like a person holding a series of lumps of bread dough. Their balance is the sum of these lumps or UTXOs. Lumps can be divided or combined before they are sent to a new address, but you always know where they came from. For example: Alice has 100g of bread dough (100 ERG). She breaks off a lump of 75g and gives it to Bob, keeping 25g of \u2018change\u2019 for herself. Charlie has 250g of dough. He breaks off 150g and gives it to Bob, keeping 100g of change for himself. Bob breaks 20g of dough off the 150g lump he received from Charlie and combines the resulting 130g with the 75g he received from Alice. He gives the total of 205g to Dave, keeping the 20g change for himself. Dave now has 205g of bread dough, which used to belong to Charlie. Before Charlie owned it, 75g used to belong to Alice, while 130g belonged to Bob. In the UTXO model, \u2018lumps\u2019 of coins can be combined and divided, but they aren\u2019t mixed together, unlike bread dough. You can follow the history of funds right back to the Coinbase transaction in which those coins were first mined. That\u2019s very different to the Account model, where the balance of each account is simply changed. (You can, of course, check the blockchain to make sure the Account says what it should, but that\u2019s not intrinsically necessary like it is with the UTXO approach.) Why UTXO? The UXTO model has several implications. For a start, each object is immutable \u2013 lumps of coins cannot be \u2018edited\u2019 like an Account balance is edited when a transaction is made. The balance is calculated from the transaction history, right back to when those coins first came into existence. That makes security much simpler because either a UTXO exists in the form you are expecting, or it does not exist at all. With the account model, you need to carefully check that the account you\u2019re dealing with is in the state it should be (and developers typically don\u2019t do that correctly). This also makes UTXOs more friendly for off-chain protocols, like sidechains and the Lightning Network. Accounts make it easier to store the \u2018state\u2019, but easy doesn\u2019t always mean better. With Ergo\u2019s extended UTXO model, state transitions are more explicit and cleaner \u2013 there are no unwanted surprises. It might be a bit more burdensome to deal with, but it\u2019s a lot better and more straightforward in terms of security.

The small businesses that are getting not much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital. This is what inspired me. This is my dream. Proof-of-Work Ergo uses Autolykos as the underlying PoW algorithm. Autolykos v2 (the current version of PoW) is a memory-hard ASIC-resistant PoW algorithm oriented towards GPUs. eUTXO The platform's smart contracts are built on the extended UTXO (eUTXO) model with a unique data input concept, offering a radically different approach to provide robust, flexible cryptography and easy, safe scripting on privacy-centric Sigma Protocols (non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs). Ergo is a UTXO based blockchain with Proof-of-Work consensus. In this aspect, it is similar to Bitcoin. Ergo uses standard Elliptic Curve Cryptography with the same curve as Bitcoin ( Secp256k1 ). Unlike Bitcoin and similar to Cardano, Ergo uses a so-called \"extended-UTXO model,\" which implies UTXOs with the ability to contain arbitrary data and sophisticated scripts. Due to this, Ergo supports advanced financial contracts similar to those in Ethereum's account-based model. ErgoScript Ergo provides advanced programming abilities for financial contracts using a high-level language called ErgoScript. The scripting language in itself is non-Turing complete, but applications run on the platform can be made to be Turing complete as demonstrated in this peer-reviewed paper . Ergo provides superior support for real-world financial agreements. It does this through: Support for multi-stage contracts A simple high-level language, ErgoScript, enabling clear descriptions of contractual logic Support for formal verification of contracts for improved security guarantees (Ergo Platform deployed its first formally verified p2p crowdfunding contract just three months after the network launched) Easy Oracle creation Native support for complex signature schemes In short, creating financial contracts on the blockchain isn\u2019t just about the functionality you provide. It\u2019s about making that functionality safe and accessible, as well as powerful. Ergo achieves this and more. Sigma Protocols The cryptographic part of ErgoScript is based on Sigma Protocols and naturally supports threshold m-of-n signatures, ring signatures, and more. Keeping all this in mind, we expect ErgoScript and Ergo's design to be uniquely useful as Contractual Money with countless possible applications. NIPoPoWs Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work ( NIPoPoWs ) are essential for two reasons: Light Clients and Side Chains. These two components are essential for clients and nodes to facilitate easier onboarding to the blockchain. A decentralized network is inherently inefficient because of the randomness mechanism in a synchronous network; that is to say, every time a transaction (TX) occurs on the network, a couple of random nodes must process the TX to prove and secure its reliability. When put into perspective, that is an enormous task on a global scale. There can be billions of transactions, and it is plausible that many of those are from contributors operating with low bandwidth. Storage Rent Another unique feature of Ergo is the concept of storage-rent, which is the ability of miners to take out a small amount of Ergs from boxes that have remained unspent for four or more years (the box is spent, and a new box is created with the lower value). This allows Ergo to avoid long-term bloat of the UTXO set. Scaling The scaling aspect in Ergo Platform's design has been a high priority since the mainnet launch. In order to gain mass adoption, a blockchain should be able to scale. Scalability refers to the efficient use of computational resources and high throughput. Ergo incorporates various elements to achieve near-infinite scalability. The design is built on the extended UTXO model with its novel language, ErgoScript, relying on peer-reviewed academic research. With years of research, Ergo developed various features such as stateless clients, NIPoPoWs and UTXO based smart contracts. Initially, Layer 0 is the reference layer where nodes are connected. This is the peer-to-peer infrastructure layer. The Ergo Node Client has improved a lot since v4.0.8 and still has 20 times more room to develop. Light bootstrapping using NIPoPoWs are also planned to be integrated via a Velvet soft fork. On Layer 1, the application layer, Ergo supports on-chain scalability solutions such as Sharding. Aside from Sharding, the extended UTXO model allows most of the transactions to be executed off-chain and reduces on-chain network load. In the end, there are Layer 2 scaling solutions that refer to off-chain layer scaling solutions. There are multiple off-chain solutions such as Hydra and sidechains to compress blockchain bloat and provide similar benefits like zk-rollups. Ergo can also be compatible with other UTXO Layer 2 solutions such as Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network. Stateless clients allow for both light wallets and light miners to run with full node security. NIPoPoW implementation via Velvet soft forks will enable infinite sidechains on top of Ergo. Ergo utilizes \" Storage Rent Fee \" to prevent spam and recirculate unused data bytes, known as dust. Storage Rent Fee helps to clean the network pollution and encourages users to be more active. Ergo Platform has a research-based approach for long-term success and it has a lot in the toolbox to tackle the scaling problems that will come in the future.

It is a thin wrapper around core components provided by the ErgoScript interpreter and Ergo protocol implementations which are written in Scala. It is published on maven repository and cross compiled to both Java 7 and Java 8+ jars. Using Appkit Ergo applications can be written in one of the languages supported by GraalVM (i.e. Java, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, Ruby, R) and using this library applications can communicate with Ergo nodes via unified API and programming model provided by Appkit. In addition Appkit based Ergo applications can be compiled into native code using native-image ahead of time compiler and then executed without Java VM with very fast startup time and lower runtime memory overhead compared to a Java VM. This is attractive option for high-performance low-latency microservices. Tutorials Tutorial starting with Appkit on Gradle projects AppKit by Example (Video) Appkit Examples How-to Guides Ergo Android | Example Android application which demonstrates how Ergo Appkit can be used to develop Ergo applications running on Android. Explanations AppKit Introduction . References ErgoTool | A Command Line Interface for Ergo based on Appkit and GraalVM native-image. Read the introduction and overview . Ergo Appkit is a library for polyglot development of Ergo Applications based on GraalVM . GraalVM has many great use cases . Expanding on that, in this article we will go through some of the Appkit features inherited from GraalVM and take you step-by-step in learning how to take advantage of them. Example Scenario We will create a simple console application (called FreezeCoin ) in Java which uses the Appkit library. By using Appkit, we will be able to easily send a new transaction to an Ergo node programatically. The transaction will transfer a given amount of Erg into a new box protected by the following Ergo contract written in ErgoScript (see this introduction and more advanced examples to learn more about ErgoScript). // Freezer Contract { // Parameters // freezeDeadline: Int - some future block number after which the box can be spent // ownerPk: SigmaProp - public key of the new box owner sigmaProp(HEIGHT > freezeDeadline) && ownerPk } In short, a box (and therefore the funds within the box) are locked under a contract (or script) on the Ergo blockchain. In order for the box to be spent, the contract must evaluate to true. Thus the individual who wishes to spend the box must ensure that the contract evaluates to true based off of the encoded logic within it. Our Freezer contract above checks the following conditions before allowing the box to be spent: The current block number of the Ergo blockchain (aka blockchain HEIGHT) is greater than the specified deadline The spending transaction must be signed by the owner of the secret key corresponding to the ownerPk public key. The first condition forbids anyone from spending the box before the Ergo blockchain grows to the given height. Because new blocks on the blockchain are mined approximately every 2 minutes on average, using the current blockchain height it is easy to define any duration of delay we wish such as 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month. (i.e. (60 / 2) * 24 * 7 = 5040, which is the # of blocks per week) . We will now be going in depth on how we can take this Freezer Contract and integrate it with the Apkit library in order to create the FreezeCoin console application so that anyone and everyone can choose to freeze their coins if they so wish. (Granted, this contract/dApp is not actually useful, however it is an effective simple example for displaying how this technology stack works so that you yourself can build useful dApps down the line.) 1. Java Ergo App Development Appkit aims to provide a set of interfaces which can be used idiomatically in Java. You will feel right at home using Appkit if you are a Java veteran. Please follow the setup instructions for GraalVM and Appkit if you wish to reproduce the examples below. To use Appkit in our Java implementation of FreezeCoin we must add the following dependency in the gradle file dependencies { implementation(\"org.ergoplatform\", \"ergo-appkit_2.12\", \"3.1.0\", \"compile\") ... } Furthermore at runtime Appkit/our application needs to connect with an Ergo Node via REST API. Often, the node will be running locally and made available at http://localhost:9052/ . This is the standard scenario for anyone who has set up a full-node by following these instructions and is using the default configuration. Henceforth we will assume that you have setup and started your Ergo Node so that it is available for testing of the application. Next, our application will need to know how to be able to a connect to our local running node, in addition to other various settings in order to function properly. We will use a json file with the following configuration parameters which our FreezeCoin app will load at startup. freeze_coin_config.json: { \"node\": { \"nodeApi\": { \"apiUrl\": \"http://localhost:9052/\", \"apiKey\": \"put your secret apiKey generated during node setup here\" }, \"wallet\": { \"mnemonic\": \"the mnemonic key used to initialize or restore the wallet of the node\", \"password\": \"the password you chose to protect the wallet\", \"mnemonicPassword\": \"the password you chose to protect the mnemonic\" }, \"networkType\": \"TESTNET\" }, \"parameters\": { \"newBoxSpendingDelay\": \"30\", \"ownerAddress\": \"3WzR39tWQ5cxxWWX6ys7wNdJKLijPeyaKgx72uqg9FJRBCdZPovL\" } } Here apiKey is the secret key required for API authentication which can be acquired as described here . Your mnemonic is the secret phrase obtained during setup of a new wallet . How our app will work is that the user will launch it from the command line and provide one argument. This argument is the amount of value (in NanoErgs) which they wish to freeze/lock under the Freezer contract which we wrote above. Our first step for our FreezeCoin app will be to read the configuration json file we just created and to accept the command line argument from the user: public static void main(String[] args) { long amountToSend = Long.parseLong(args[0]); // positive value in NanoErg ErgoToolConfig conf = ErgoToolConfig.load(\"freeze_coin_config.json\"); // the rest of the code discussed below ... } With these acquired, we can now obtain the spending delay and the owner address which were defined in the json config file. int newBoxSpendingDelay = Integer.parseInt(conf.getParameters().get(\"newBoxSpendingDelay\")); Address ownerAddress = Address.create(conf.getParameters().get(\"ownerAddress\")); Next we need to connect to the running Ergo node from our Java application so that we can use the data we just parsed and post something on-chain. This is done by creating an ErgoClient instance which uses our pre-defined values for our node from the json config file as well. ErgoNodeConfig nodeConf = conf.getNode(); ErgoClient ergoClient = RestApiErgoClient.create(nodeConf); Now that we have an instance of ErgoClient , we can execute any block of code and have access to the current blockchain context. String txJson = ergoClient.execute((BlockchainContext ctx) -> { // use ctx here to create and sign a new transaction // then send it to the node }); The lambda passed to execute is called when the current blockchain context is loaded from the Ergo node. In this lambda we shall put our application logic. First we start with some auxiliary steps. // access the wallet embedded in the Ergo node // (using the wallet specified via mnemonic we put in freeze_coin_config.json) ErgoWallet wallet = ctx.getWallet(); // calculate total amount of NanoErgs we need to send to the new box // including paying for transaction fees long totalToSpend = amountToSend + Parameters.MinFee; // request for unspent boxes that cover the required amount of NanoErgs from the wallet Optional<List<InputBox>> boxes = wallet.getUnspentBoxes(totalToSpend); if (!boxes.isPresent()) throw new ErgoClientException( \"Not enough coins in your specified wallet to pay \" + totalToSpend, null); // create a \"prover\", which is a special object that will be used for signing the transaction // the prover should be configured with your wallet's secrets, which are necessary to generate signatures (aka proofs) ErgoProver prover = ctx.newProverBuilder() .withMnemonic( nodeConf.getWallet().getMnemonic(), nodeConf.getWallet().getPassword()) .build(); At this point we have the input boxes chosen for our spending transaction, but we now need to create an output box with the specified amountToSend and locked under the Freezer contract. // the only way to create a transaction is using the tx builder obtained from the context // the builder uses the context to access necessary blockchain data. UnsignedTransactionBuilder txB = ctx.newTxBuilder(); // create new box using new builder obtained from the transaction builder // in this case we compile a new ErgoContract from the Freezer ErgoScript code OutBox newBox = txB.outBoxBuilder() .value(amountToPay) .contract(ctx.compileContract( ConstantsBuilder.create() .item(\"freezeDeadline\", ctx.getHeight() + newBoxSpendingDelay) .item(\"ownerPk\", ownerAddress.getPublicKey()) .build(), \"{ sigmaProp(HEIGHT > freezeDeadline) && ownerPk }\")) .build(); Note, in order to compile ErgoContract from the Freezer script source code the compileContract method requires that we provide values for named constants which are used within the script. If no such constants are used, then ConstantsBuilder.empty() can be passed to it. In this case we pass the public key of the new box owner into the ownerPk placeholder in the script. To repeat from earlier, this means that the box can only be spent by the owner of the corresponding secret key. Next, we create an unsigned transaction using all the data we've put together thus far. // provide the transaction builder with which boxes we are going to spend, which outputs // should be created, the total transaction fees, and the address for change to be sent to UnsignedTransaction tx = txB.boxesToSpend(boxes.get()) .outputs(newBox) .fee(Parameters.MinFee) .sendChangeTo(prover.getP2PKAddress()) .build(); And finally we: Use the prover to sign the built transaction Thus obtain a SignedTransaction instance Use the blockchain context to send the signed transaction to the Ergo node. The resulting txId can be used to refer to this transaction later however we do not use it here. SignedTransaction signed = prover.sign(tx); String txId = ctx.sendTransaction(signed); return signed.toJson(true); As you may have noticed, for our final step we show off that it is possible to serialize the signed transaction into a Json string with pretty printing turned on. Look at the full source code of the example for more details and for using it as a template in your own application. Now with all of the code set in stone, we can run our FreezeCoin application using the following steps (assuming you are in the directory where you cloned ergo-appkit-examples ). $ pwd the/directory/you/cloned/ergo-appkit-examples $ ./gradlew clean shadowJar This will assemble the build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar file containing our FreezeCoin Java application and all of its dependencies in a single fat jar. Note, this step has to be repeated after any changes are made to the Java source code of our application. Having created our application, we can now use our FreezeCoin app: $ java -cp build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar \\ org.ergoplatform.appkit.examples.FreezeCoin 1000000000 You will get something along the lines of this output in the console . And with that your transaction was accepted by the Ergo node and broadcast into the network where it shall lay await in the transaction pool to be added to a block. Once a miner selects and adds it to a block, your coins will be officially \"frozen\" within the newly created box based off of the values you provided to the FreezeCoin application. The example assumes the Ergo node (and the embedded wallet) is owned by the FreezeCoin user. However this is not strictly required and the Appkit interfaces can be used to create and send new transactions using arbitrary public Ergo nodes. 2. Low-footprint, Fast-startup Ergo Applications As you may know, using Java for short-running processes has a lot of drawbacks. Applications tend to suffer from long startup times and relatively high memory usage. Let's run FreezeCoin using the time command to get the real (wall-clock elapsed time) it takes the entire program to run from start to finish. We use the -l flag to print the memory usage as well. $ /usr/bin/time -l java -cp build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar \\ org.ergoplatform.appkit.examples.FreezeCoin 1000000000 ... 4.97 real 8.41 user 0.69 sys 513703936 maximum resident set size 0 average shared memory size 0 average unshared data size 0 average unshared stack size 125010 page reclaims 1216 page faults 0 swaps 0 block input operations 0 block output operations 13 messages sent 86 messages received 1 signals received 2384 voluntary context switches 17409 involuntary context switches As seen above, this tiny application took 2 parallel threads almost 4 seconds to run. Most of that time can be attributed to the JVM startup and the background JIT compiler running. This is quite sub-par performance, and we know we can do a lot better. Luckily, GraalVM provides us with the perfect solution. We can solve this inherent issue with the JVM by compiling the Java code ahead-of-time into a native executable image via GraalVM. This skips over the need to use the Java just-in-time compiler at runtime. The experience for us (the developer using GraalVM) is quite similar to a conventional compiler like gcc. Note, we may need to run ./gradlew clean shadowJar first. $ ./gradlew clean shadowJar $ native-image --no-server \\ -cp build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar\\ --report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime\\ --no-fallback -H:+TraceClassInitialization -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces\\ -H:+AddAllCharsets -H:+AllowVMInspection -H:-RuntimeAssertions\\ --allow-incomplete-classpath \\ --enable-url-protocols=http,https org.ergoplatform.appkit.examples.FreezeCoin freezecoin [freezecoin:3133] classlist: 35,217.78 ms [freezecoin:3133] (cap): 6,063.07 ms [freezecoin:3133] setup: 8,268.99 ms [freezecoin:3133] (typeflow): 60,238.25 ms [freezecoin:3133] (objects): 33,009.06 ms [freezecoin:3133] (features): 4,796.86 ms [freezecoin:3133] analysis: 102,876.01 ms [freezecoin:3133] (clinit): 11,642.43 ms [freezecoin:3133] universe: 13,718.96 ms [freezecoin:3133] (parse): 5,053.18 ms [freezecoin:3133] (inline): 18,317.24 ms [freezecoin:3133] (compile): 44,806.82 ms [freezecoin:3133] compile: 72,288.24 ms [freezecoin:3133] image: 7,955.29 ms [freezecoin:3133] write: 2,872.25 ms [freezecoin:3133] [total]: 243,813.30 ms The simple command above produces a complete native executable called freezecoin . To emphasize, this executable isn\u2019t a mere launcher for the JVM. In fact it doesn\u2019t link to the JVM or bundle the JVM in any way. native-image compiles the FreezeCoin code, as well as any Java libraries it depends on, all the way down to simple machine code. If we look at the libraries which freezecoin uses you can see that it only uses standard system libraries. Thus, we can move just this one executable to another system which doesn't have a JVM installed and it will run there without issue. $ otool -L freezecoin # ldd freezecoin on Linux freezecoin: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1252.50.4) /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 1455.12.0) /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.11) If we time this new freezecoin executable, we can see that it starts approximately 8x faster, and uses around 6x less memory. What this means is that you don\u2019t feel that palpable pause you always get when running a short-running program with the JVM. $ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GRAAL_HOME/jre/lib /usr/bin/time -l ./freezecoin 1800000000 0.43 real 0.15 user 0.03 sys 81289216 maximum resident set size 0 average shared memory size 0 average unshared data size 0 average unshared stack size 20079 page reclaims 0 page faults 0 swaps 0 block input operations 0 block output operations 13 messages sent 86 messages received 0 signals received 11 voluntary context switches 138 involuntary context switches This is just one of the great benefits of GraalVM which we get to take advantage of with Appkit. 3. Develop Ergo Applications in JavaScript, Python, Ruby GraalVM supports so called polyglot programming in which different components of an application can be developed using the most suitable language and then seamlessly combine together at runtime. In this way a unique library written in say Java can be used in a node.js application written in JavaScript for example. To support polyglot programming GraalVM platform has it's own high performance implementations of popular languages. We are going to take advantage of this for our FreezeCoin example project to show you how easy this is to use your preferred language. Before running the examples below (in JavaScript, Python and Ruby) please make sure that you have the Java version of FreezeCoin working locally in order to ensure everything is set up correctly. JavaScript GraalVM can run JavaScript and Node.js applications out of the box. It is compatible with the ECMAScript 2019 specification . Additionally, js and node launchers accept special --jvm and --polyglot command line options which allow JS scripts to access Java objects and classes. Given that being the case, a JS implementation of FreezeCoin can be easily written using the Appkit API interface. Please see the full source code of FreezeCoin JS implementation for details. The following command use node launcher to execute FreezeCoin.js script. $ node --jvm --vm.cp=build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar \\ js-examples/FreezeCoin.js 1000000000 Note, the paths in the command are relative to the root of ergo-appkit-examples project directory. Python GraalVM can run Python scripts , though the Python implementation is still experimental (see also compatibility section for details). Python example of FreezeCoin can be executed using the following command $ graalpython --jvm --polyglot --vm.cp=build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar \\ python-examples/FreezeCoin.py 1900000000 Ruby GraalVM can run Ruby scripts using TruffleRuby implementation, which is however still experimental (see also compatibility section for details). TruffleRuby aims to be fully compatible with the standard implementation of Ruby, MRI, version 2.6.2 Ruby example of FreezeCoin can be executed using the following command $ truffleruby --polyglot --jvm --vm.cp=build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar \\ ruby-examples/FreezeCoin.rb 1900000000 4. Ergo Native Shared Libraries Another great benefit of GraalVM is that we can compile Java classes down into a native shared library instead of an executable.

Truffle allows for tooling like debuggers to be implemented once and be available for all supported languages.

From here we can set breakpoints and continue execution. When it breaks we\u2019ll see values of the variables, can continue again until the next breakpoint, and do everything we've come to expect from debuggers. Conclusions And with all of that said and done, we see just how easy it is to use Appkit to develop Ergo Applications. Appkit relies on the same exact core libraries which were used in implementing the Ergo consensus protocol. These libraries include the ErgoScript compiler, cryptography, byte code interpreter, data serialisers and the other core components. Using GraalVM we are able to reuse these tried and tested components in different application contexts without any modification or rewriting them ourselves. No matter if you are using Java, JavaScript, Python or Ruby, you can take advantage of Appkit with GraalVM to drastically simplify the process of interacting with the Ergo blockchain while creating native-running (d)Apps. Stay tuned. In future posts we will introduce you to other interesting potential applications powered by Appkit.

By using Appkit, we will be able to easily send a new transaction to an Ergo node programatically. The transaction will transfer a given amount of Erg into a new box protected by the following Ergo contract written in ErgoScript (see this introduction and more advanced examples to learn more about ErgoScript). // Freezer Contract { // Parameters // freezeDeadline: Int - some future block number after which the box can be spent // ownerPk: SigmaProp - public key of the new box owner sigmaProp(HEIGHT > freezeDeadline) && ownerPk } In short, a box (and therefore the funds within the box) are locked under a contract (or script) on the Ergo blockchain. In order for the box to be spent, the contract must evaluate to true. Thus the individual who wishes to spend the box must ensure that the contract evaluates to true based off of the encoded logic within it. Our Freezer contract above checks the following conditions before allowing the box to be spent: The current block number of the Ergo blockchain (aka blockchain HEIGHT) is greater than the specified deadline The spending transaction must be signed by the owner of the secret key corresponding to the ownerPk public key. The first condition forbids anyone from spending the box before the Ergo blockchain grows to the given height. Because new blocks on the blockchain are mined approximately every 2 minutes on average, using the current blockchain height it is easy to define any duration of delay we wish such as 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month. (i.e. (60 / 2) * 24 * 7 = 5040, which is the # of blocks per week) . We will now be going in depth on how we can take this Freezer Contract and integrate it with the Apkit library in order to create the FreezeCoin console application so that anyone and everyone can choose to freeze their coins if they so wish. (Granted, this contract/dApp is not actually useful, however it is an effective simple example for displaying how this technology stack works so that you yourself can build useful dApps down the line.)","title":"Example Scenario"},{"location":"dev/lib/appkit/#1-java-ergo-app-development","text":"Appkit aims to provide a set of interfaces which can be used idiomatically in Java. You will feel right at home using Appkit if you are a Java veteran. Please follow the setup instructions for GraalVM and Appkit if you wish to reproduce the examples below. To use Appkit in our Java implementation of FreezeCoin we must add the following dependency in the gradle file dependencies { implementation(\"org.ergoplatform\", \"ergo-appkit_2.12\", \"3.1.0\", \"compile\") ... } Furthermore at runtime Appkit/our application needs to connect with an Ergo Node via REST API. Often, the node will be running locally and made available at http://localhost:9052/ . This is the standard scenario for anyone who has set up a full-node by following these instructions and is using the default configuration. Henceforth we will assume that you have setup and started your Ergo Node so that it is available for testing of the application. Next, our application will need to know how to be able to a connect to our local running node, in addition to other various settings in order to function properly. We will use a json file with the following configuration parameters which our FreezeCoin app will load at startup. freeze_coin_config.json: { \"node\": { \"nodeApi\": { \"apiUrl\": \"http://localhost:9052/\", \"apiKey\": \"put your secret apiKey generated during node setup here\" }, \"wallet\": { \"mnemonic\": \"the mnemonic key used to initialize or restore the wallet of the node\", \"password\": \"the password you chose to protect the wallet\", \"mnemonicPassword\": \"the password you chose to protect the mnemonic\" }, \"networkType\": \"TESTNET\" }, \"parameters\": { \"newBoxSpendingDelay\": \"30\", \"ownerAddress\": \"3WzR39tWQ5cxxWWX6ys7wNdJKLijPeyaKgx72uqg9FJRBCdZPovL\" } } Here apiKey is the secret key required for API authentication which can be acquired as described here . Your mnemonic is the secret phrase obtained during setup of a new wallet . How our app will work is that the user will launch it from the command line and provide one argument. This argument is the amount of value (in NanoErgs) which they wish to freeze/lock under the Freezer contract which we wrote above. Our first step for our FreezeCoin app will be to read the configuration json file we just created and to accept the command line argument from the user: public static void main(String[] args) { long amountToSend = Long.parseLong(args[0]); // positive value in NanoErg ErgoToolConfig conf = ErgoToolConfig.load(\"freeze_coin_config.json\"); // the rest of the code discussed below ... } With these acquired, we can now obtain the spending delay and the owner address which were defined in the json config file. int newBoxSpendingDelay = Integer.parseInt(conf.getParameters().get(\"newBoxSpendingDelay\")); Address ownerAddress = Address.create(conf.getParameters().get(\"ownerAddress\")); Next we need to connect to the running Ergo node from our Java application so that we can use the data we just parsed and post something on-chain. This is done by creating an ErgoClient instance which uses our pre-defined values for our node from the json config file as well. ErgoNodeConfig nodeConf = conf.getNode(); ErgoClient ergoClient = RestApiErgoClient.create(nodeConf); Now that we have an instance of ErgoClient , we can execute any block of code and have access to the current blockchain context. String txJson = ergoClient.execute((BlockchainContext ctx) -> { // use ctx here to create and sign a new transaction // then send it to the node }); The lambda passed to execute is called when the current blockchain context is loaded from the Ergo node. In this lambda we shall put our application logic. First we start with some auxiliary steps. // access the wallet embedded in the Ergo node // (using the wallet specified via mnemonic we put in freeze_coin_config.json) ErgoWallet wallet = ctx.getWallet(); // calculate total amount of NanoErgs we need to send to the new box // including paying for transaction fees long totalToSpend = amountToSend + Parameters.MinFee; // request for unspent boxes that cover the required amount of NanoErgs from the wallet Optional<List<InputBox>> boxes = wallet.getUnspentBoxes(totalToSpend); if (!boxes.isPresent()) throw new ErgoClientException( \"Not enough coins in your specified wallet to pay \" + totalToSpend, null); // create a \"prover\", which is a special object that will be used for signing the transaction // the prover should be configured with your wallet's secrets, which are necessary to generate signatures (aka proofs) ErgoProver prover = ctx.newProverBuilder() .withMnemonic( nodeConf.getWallet().getMnemonic(), nodeConf.getWallet().getPassword()) .build(); At this point we have the input boxes chosen for our spending transaction, but we now need to create an output box with the specified amountToSend and locked under the Freezer contract. // the only way to create a transaction is using the tx builder obtained from the context // the builder uses the context to access necessary blockchain data. UnsignedTransactionBuilder txB = ctx.newTxBuilder(); // create new box using new builder obtained from the transaction builder // in this case we compile a new ErgoContract from the Freezer ErgoScript code OutBox newBox = txB.outBoxBuilder() .value(amountToPay) .contract(ctx.compileContract( ConstantsBuilder.create() .item(\"freezeDeadline\", ctx.getHeight() + newBoxSpendingDelay) .item(\"ownerPk\", ownerAddress.getPublicKey()) .build(), \"{ sigmaProp(HEIGHT > freezeDeadline) && ownerPk }\")) .build(); Note, in order to compile ErgoContract from the Freezer script source code the compileContract method requires that we provide values for named constants which are used within the script. If no such constants are used, then ConstantsBuilder.empty() can be passed to it. In this case we pass the public key of the new box owner into the ownerPk placeholder in the script. To repeat from earlier, this means that the box can only be spent by the owner of the corresponding secret key. Next, we create an unsigned transaction using all the data we've put together thus far. // provide the transaction builder with which boxes we are going to spend, which outputs // should be created, the total transaction fees, and the address for change to be sent to UnsignedTransaction tx = txB.boxesToSpend(boxes.get()) .outputs(newBox) .fee(Parameters.MinFee) .sendChangeTo(prover.getP2PKAddress()) .build(); And finally we: Use the prover to sign the built transaction Thus obtain a SignedTransaction instance Use the blockchain context to send the signed transaction to the Ergo node. The resulting txId can be used to refer to this transaction later however we do not use it here. SignedTransaction signed = prover.sign(tx); String txId = ctx.sendTransaction(signed); return signed.toJson(true); As you may have noticed, for our final step we show off that it is possible to serialize the signed transaction into a Json string with pretty printing turned on. Look at the full source code of the example for more details and for using it as a template in your own application. Now with all of the code set in stone, we can run our FreezeCoin application using the following steps (assuming you are in the directory where you cloned ergo-appkit-examples ). $ pwd the/directory/you/cloned/ergo-appkit-examples $ ./gradlew clean shadowJar This will assemble the build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar file containing our FreezeCoin Java application and all of its dependencies in a single fat jar. Note, this step has to be repeated after any changes are made to the Java source code of our application. Having created our application, we can now use our FreezeCoin app: $ java -cp build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar \\ org.ergoplatform.appkit.examples.FreezeCoin 1000000000 You will get something along the lines of this output in the console . And with that your transaction was accepted by the Ergo node and broadcast into the network where it shall lay await in the transaction pool to be added to a block. Once a miner selects and adds it to a block, your coins will be officially \"frozen\" within the newly created box based off of the values you provided to the FreezeCoin application. The example assumes the Ergo node (and the embedded wallet) is owned by the FreezeCoin user. However this is not strictly required and the Appkit interfaces can be used to create and send new transactions using arbitrary public Ergo nodes.","title":"1. Java Ergo App Development"},{"location":"dev/lib/appkit/#2-low-footprint-fast-startup-ergo-applications","text":"As you may know, using Java for short-running processes has a lot of drawbacks. Applications tend to suffer from long startup times and relatively high memory usage. Let's run FreezeCoin using the time command to get the real (wall-clock elapsed time) it takes the entire program to run from start to finish. We use the -l flag to print the memory usage as well. $ /usr/bin/time -l java -cp build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar \\ org.ergoplatform.appkit.examples.FreezeCoin 1000000000 ... 4.97 real 8.41 user 0.69 sys 513703936 maximum resident set size 0 average shared memory size 0 average unshared data size 0 average unshared stack size 125010 page reclaims 1216 page faults 0 swaps 0 block input operations 0 block output operations 13 messages sent 86 messages received 1 signals received 2384 voluntary context switches 17409 involuntary context switches As seen above, this tiny application took 2 parallel threads almost 4 seconds to run. Most of that time can be attributed to the JVM startup and the background JIT compiler running. This is quite sub-par performance, and we know we can do a lot better. Luckily, GraalVM provides us with the perfect solution. We can solve this inherent issue with the JVM by compiling the Java code ahead-of-time into a native executable image via GraalVM. This skips over the need to use the Java just-in-time compiler at runtime. The experience for us (the developer using GraalVM) is quite similar to a conventional compiler like gcc.

To emphasize, this executable isn\u2019t a mere launcher for the JVM. In fact it doesn\u2019t link to the JVM or bundle the JVM in any way. native-image compiles the FreezeCoin code, as well as any Java libraries it depends on, all the way down to simple machine code. If we look at the libraries which freezecoin uses you can see that it only uses standard system libraries. Thus, we can move just this one executable to another system which doesn't have a JVM installed and it will run there without issue. $ otool -L freezecoin # ldd freezecoin on Linux freezecoin: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1252.50.4) /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 1455.12.0) /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.11) If we time this new freezecoin executable, we can see that it starts approximately 8x faster, and uses around 6x less memory. What this means is that you don\u2019t feel that palpable pause you always get when running a short-running program with the JVM. $ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GRAAL_HOME/jre/lib /usr/bin/time -l ./freezecoin 1800000000 0.43 real 0.15 user 0.03 sys 81289216 maximum resident set size 0 average shared memory size 0 average unshared data size 0 average unshared stack size 20079 page reclaims 0 page faults 0 swaps 0 block input operations 0 block output operations 13 messages sent 86 messages received 0 signals received 11 voluntary context switches 138 involuntary context switches This is just one of the great benefits of GraalVM which we get to take advantage of with Appkit.","title":"2.

The Problem Currently, with libraries like ergo-appkit, ergo-lib (aka sigma-rust), and ergo-ts, development on Ergo has become a lot more convenient and is becoming easier with further developments of ergo-lib. However, there are some big barriers for dApps to be extensively used by ordinary users. One of the main ones is that users can't use their assets to participate in dApps because current wallets don't support some key features needed by dApps like: - specifying input boxes - p2s protected boxes in inputs - specifying output registers - and simply not supporting dApp requests These issues will be resolved in the future for sure with wallets like Yoroi, but not so soon maybe! In this situation, dApps have no workarounds other than requiring users to have their node running or implement kind of a wallet themselves and ask users to trust and deposit there! The former is the case with Ergo Auction House which prevents it from being extensively used by everyone! Specifically, the problem that this topic is going to address is to bypass the node requirements by having an off-chain service to assemble arbitrary transactions for dApps. A Solution The off-chain service will allow dApps to register some requests by proving an address (which user will deposit her assets to) and some other specifications. This topic is just for getting feedback and I still haven't designed the APIs to provide concrete examples, however: { \"address\":\"address which user deposits to\", // p2s address explained in Trusting Issues section \"returnTo\":\"address to return assets to in case of failure\", \"startWhen\":{ // start assembling when all needed assets are deposited maybe with multiple transactions \"erg\":1002000000, \"d01bdce3959ff6b675f7ab40ec2479ca5ce1edf3ae6314631f09c0f9807752aa\":71 }, \"txSpec\":{ \"requests\":[ { \"address\":\"MFrQp7bsMkG9u1AQT33hn5ydUAcrqNMxhocS1RvvJqmUcHaiyXcCE3Sg7DbphepEXHXPkhEBzC6Kqw7jzQDzd4a9SX9M96b4NV8vTVp1zJGepnX41yuLzdWPzbB3k1XRTCUe7An26NDozTD3L5brAu5Nu5Pxkk28kNiFMtfG76n4yfF5YB1wbzXrfoaM9qVTFKhjLTRpJ1pwFZgzPnDC3LXEDyk4EPRjqnRe4WSnMhqa6ngfdGG79J4ZphMuDtamsJY7RD1PoWwxvidk9by7iQrQ3v9EGn1QkrtpxFN9Di7nsyKzUzQS6vxhpdcGXTRBhghaZPMnqRyzdhtspJxiYewSB14Q2cF1uR7vz3m6cqLuS7Fw8jKMpfsY9wXLRaHqUnzfJtEf7LTJfGHtCxifo2iuiHowkLWtwgZDNjH5UAiwAXubSuCzFVSZaDDyxdA5mqBSSRbSC8LoZvQwPcfFLvjjnx2nNznokdG6vA7LU8BbmXrnVXR\", \"value\":1000000000, \"assets\":[ { \"tokenId\":\"d01bdce3959ff6b675f7ab40ec2479ca5ce1edf3ae6314631f09c0f9807752aa\", \"amount\":71 } ], \"registers\":{ \"R4\":\"0e240008cd02d84d2e1ca735ce23f224bd43cd43ed67053356713a8a6920965b3bde933648dc\", \"R5\":\"04bacf2a\", \"R6\":\"0580a8d6b907\", \"R7\":\"0e0131\", \"R8\":\"0e240008cd02d84d2e1ca735ce23f224bd43cd43ed67053356713a8a6920965b3bde933648dc\", \"R9\":\"0e1c313030303030303030302c313030303030303030302c333439313433\" } } ], \"inputs\":[ \"$userIns\", \"boxId1\", \"boxId2\", \"...\" ], \"dataInputs\":[ \"boxId1\", \"...\" ], \"fee\":2000000 } } The above is a potential request that Ergo Auction House can register to the service which will start a new auction! So the Ergo Auction House app will ask the user to deposit the required assets to the address (will discuss what this address actually is in the next sections) using their favorite wallet and registers the request to the service. After such a request, the service will follow the address and when the conditions are met, assembles the tx and makes sure it will be mined. In case of failures, assets will be returned to the user; for example if the tx is for placing a bid and someone else places a bid before us! Note that all input and data input boxes are in ids and no input raw will be required, makes it safe for dApps to avoid running nodes for themselves, or use random nodes in the network to get raw inputs. Also, note that the above approach doesn't solve the problem of finding necessary boxes (e.g. in case of placing a bid, the auction box) for dApps and it isn't the aim of this topic as well! Furthermore, the txSpec is pretty raw, can be improved so that the service encodes the register to make it easier for dApps, but with the mentioned libraries around, I don't see it as a problem for dApps to encode registers themselves. With some improvements on the node's side, the service can be very fast and effective by using chained transactions to avoid wasting time for the deposits to be mined! So basically it will be like the user is running a node and is generating the tx directly without intermediate operations. Last but not least, the service will of course provide some other APIs for dApps to see the result of their registered requests. Trusting Issues How dApps and users should trust such a service is still a big problem. Several solutions: - With the service being open-sourced and maybe being provided by a trusted party - dApps can run the service for themselves, resolving the trust issue for at least themselves - Using well-designed p2s addresses to prevent the service from stealing Although one can argue that the first two options can work under some circumstances, the last option is the one which I think is applicable for most use-cases and doesn't require trust! For example, the Ergo Auction House can use p2s addresses which will allow the assets to be spent only for placing a specific bid, and the user's address being specified as auction's bidder in the auction box and register it to the service! Service Provider Incentives Although I personally don't have plans to make profits out of the service, one can have multiple options and plans to make some profits with the service. For example, the service can follow the registered request for some minutes for free and after that remove the request if the conditions are not met to assemble the transaction, then dApps can pay the service to follow the request longer! Until the dApp bridge in wallets is built, I think such a service will help a lot for the growth of dApps. Even after some wallets provide APIs for dApps, users still can benefit from such service by using any wallet they wish! Please let me know if something is overlooked. Motivation Currently, to craft a transaction, we need to use Kiosk, sigma-rust, Appkit or some other tool, which makes the entry barrier quite high. Motivated from @anon_real's Tx Assembler and other proposals, I had been working on a tool to automate tx building for the off-chain components of an Ergo dApp. The tool, called simply \"Tx Builder\" can be used to create transactions for participating in several Ergo application protocols. The goal of Tx Builder is to allow people with just knowledge of Json to craft a transaction following certain rules. Documentation There is a very short introduction here . For further details, please refer to the source code here and the examples here . More details will follow soon.

However, there are some big barriers for dApps to be extensively used by ordinary users. One of the main ones is that users can't use their assets to participate in dApps because current wallets don't support some key features needed by dApps like: - specifying input boxes - p2s protected boxes in inputs - specifying output registers - and simply not supporting dApp requests These issues will be resolved in the future for sure with wallets like Yoroi, but not so soon maybe! In this situation, dApps have no workarounds other than requiring users to have their node running or implement kind of a wallet themselves and ask users to trust and deposit there!

You can use ErgoTool without running your own Ergo node. Even though running a node is the most secure way to communicate with the Ergo blockchain network, ErgoTool however, aims to provide more foundational tools at your disposal. Surely, you still can use it with your own running node. In this post we will walk through simple steps to generate a mnemonic phrase, create a local secret storage and use it to send ERGs between addresses, all with the help of ErgoTool commands. Getting Started First of all we need to install ErgoTool on our system from sources by following the installation instructions . In the directory where we cloned ErgoTool there is ergo-tool.sh script which we are going to use to run commands. Run the following command to check ErgoTool is installed correctly. $ ./ergo-tool.sh help command name is not specified (run ergo-tool without arguments to list commands) Command Name: help Usage Syntax: ergo-tool help <commandName> Description: prints usage help for a command Doc page: https://aslesarenko.github.io/ergo-tool/api/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ergotool/HelpCmd.html Let's see what we get here. ErgoTool outputs the error message with the information about help command. This is a typical output of ErgoTool when one of the known commands is specified, but it is used incorrectly. As we can learn from the message, the help command requires us to specify additional <commandName> argument. Also, each command has an API doc page with all the details about command execution, so its url is shown here. Create a New Mnemonic Phrase Mnemonic is a random sequence of characters which is used to generate a master key according to Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets specification. For convenience random sequence of english words is used, but this is not required. Run the following command to generate a new mnemonic phrase: $ ./ergo-tool.sh mnemonic bird harbor wheat innocent business disease busy quick yellow trust time oil enter situate moon Write it down on a paper and keep in a safe and secret place. As an additional security measure you can create an arbitrary mnemonic password. In some sense it can serve like an additional non-vocabulary word in the mnemonic. Mnemonic password is optional and is used for additional security. If you decide to use mnemonic password you should also write it down and keep in a secret and probably different from mnemonic place. Important, both mnemonic phrase and mnemonic password are required to restore secret keys, if you lose any of them then you will not be able to regenerate you master key again. Next let's use the generated mnemonic to create a storage with a master secret key. Create a New Encrypted Storage For better security neither mnemonic phrase nor password is required by ErgoTool to perform the transaction signing. Instead, the secret key from the encrypted storage is required to sign spending transaction. We can generate a secret key and store it in an encrypted storage using createStorage command. $ ./ergo-tool.sh help createStorage Command Name: createStorage Usage Syntax: ergo-tool createStorage [<storageDir>=\"storage\"] [<storageFileName>=\"secret.json\"] Description: Creates an encrypted storage file for the mnemonic entered by the user Doc page: https://aslesarenko.github.io/ergo-tool/api/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ergotool/CreateStorageCmd.html $ ./ergo-tool.sh createStorage Enter mnemonic phrase> bird harbor wheat innocent business disease busy quick yellow trust time oil enter situate moon Mnemonic password> Repeat mnemonic password> Storage password> Repeat storage password> Storage File: storage/secret.json A master secret key is generated from the (mnemonic phrase, mnemonic password) pair and saved encrypted in the storage/secret.json file. Mnemonic itself is not stored in the file and there is no way to restore it from the file, even if you know the passwords. Please take care to enter correct mnemonic password, the one you chose and saved before. Since a mnemonic password is optional you can leave it empty by pressing enter. If you forget the storage password (aka encryption password), you will not be able to use that storage file anymore, however, you can always restore your secret keys from (mnemonic phrase, mnemonic password) pair and thus create a new storage file with a new password. Keep your storage file and storage password in secret, anyone who obtain both your storage file and storage password will be able to decipher it and access secret keys. Extracting Data From Storage Secret storage contains master secret key and as a result can be used to compute both the public key and the pay-to-public-key address which correspond to that secret key. The extractStorage command is doing just that. $ ./ergo-tool.sh help extractStorage Command Name: extractStorage Usage Syntax: ergo-tool extractStorage <storage file> address|masterKey|publicKey|secretKey mainnet|testnet Description: Reads the file, unlocks it using password and extract the requested property from the given storage file.

The same way we can obtain public key, private key and other data from the storage. $ ./ergo-tool.sh extractStorage storage/secret.json secretKey mainnet Storage password> 55dfde63c9b6b4f47683592e85ee997ba2e93507f38ba3f9c82933bcfbc677ca $ ./ergo-tool.sh extractStorage storage/secret.json publicKey mainnet Storage password> 03f07aecb145a85920bf6e9be80efe5f1cd1a165b45ad3aa8e5c4ca3ba50856bb8 Listing Unspent Boxes ErgoTool has the special command to list all available (aka unspent) boxes for a given address. $ ./ergo-tool.sh listAddressBoxes 9f4QF8AD1nQ3nJahQVkMj8hFSVVzVom77b52JU7EW71Zexg6N8v BoxId NanoERGs 4840cb6facc20b765085db0ad24768ed0c5e7afd413e8e58e597c33a993f8119 4987000000 if we specify --print-json option, then ErgoTool will output all the boxes in json format $ ./ergo-tool.sh listAddressBoxes --print-json 9f4QF8AD1nQ3nJahQVkMj8hFSVVzVom77b52JU7EW71Zexg6N8v [{\"boxId\":\"4840cb6facc20b765085db0ad24768ed0c5e7afd413e8e58e597c33a993f8119\",\"value\":4987000000,\"ergoTree\":\"0008cd02472963123ce32c057907c7a7268bc09f45d9ca57819d3327b9e7497d7b1cc347\",\"creationHeight\":125646,\"assets\":[],\"additionalRegisters\":{},\"transactionId\":\"820c688f4b9d709924ba0186ee930a7df374d8852920bc769fc1f1d0b313e5ab\",\"index\":2}] Transfer Coins Now, with secret key stored securely in the encrypted storage file, we can use ErgoTool to transfer coins from our address to some other recipient address. The command to do that is send . ./ergo-tool.sh help send Command Name: send Usage Syntax: ergo-tool send <storageFile> <recipientAddr> <amountToSend> Description: send the given <amountToSend> to the given <recipientAddr> using the given <storageFile> to sign transaction (requests storage password) Doc page: https://aslesarenko.github.io/ergo-tool/api/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ergotool/SendCmd.html The storage file is necessary in order to access secret key and generate a signature. The storage password will be requested by ErgoTool to unlock and decipher the file content.

So-called headless dApps are a new idea in the blockchain world, and one that offers exciting new possibilities for developers and the DeFi sector. It\u2019s also one that Ergo will be exploring in due course. Before we make further announcements, it\u2019s worth exploring the idea a little further. If you\u2019re new to the idea of headless dApps, you\u2019ll likely have questions... What are \u2018headless\u2019 dApps? Headless dApps are a brand new technical and business model for developing dApps that is just beginning to take hold in the blockchain space. Headless dApps are the pure and portable self-contained logic for reading and participating in on-chain smart contract protocols. In other words, a headless dApp is a piece of software that exposes the complex on-chain protocols to the off-chain world with a streamlined interface that anyone can build on. The dApps themselves have no frontend of their own \u2013 hence they are \u2018headless\u2019. Why is that a good thing? Headless dApps provide the freedom to build an entire decentralized ecosystem. Because headless dApps are pure and portable by default, they can be compiled to any desktop OS, mobile OS, or browser. Because they have a streamlined interface, they can be integrated into scripts and bots trivially. Because they are composable, they can be used together in applications \u2013 for example, to enable arbitrage between different protocols, or entire new user experiences to be developed without having to understand how each and every supported headless dApp works in detail. This makes them ideal for newer devs with limited experience of developing smart contract protocols.

Ergo HDF is a Rust framework for building Ergo Headless dApps. It provides developers with the very first portable UTXO-based headless dApp development framework on any blockchain. The Ergo HDF project makes it easy for developers who are new to blockchain to create dApps without understanding smart contracts in detail, but has a number of goals: Enable developers to write their off-chain logic only once, using the HDF to create their own headless dApps, thereby allowing them to target all platforms (desktop, web, mobile) easily. Provide developers with an easy experience to go from Ergo dApp Specifications to headless dApps with greater assurance and a straightforward implementation path. Separate dApps\u2019 off-chain logic from frontend logic, thereby allowing reusability no matter what application or front-end is attempting to integrate a headless dApp. Provide easy-to-use methods for front-end developers to access the current state of the dApp protocol, without having to understand how any of it works.

Some notable examples are the Sigma-USD stable coin bank and ErgoMixer. Interacting with such smart contracts requires a developer to write code in a language such as Scala (using the App-Kit framework) or Rust (using HDF / sigma-rust) JSON dApp Environment (JDE) is another programming tool that can be used to interact with Ergo dApps. The differentiating feature of JDE is that its programming language is JSON. Goals JDE is designed with the following goals: Enable tech-savvy users and developers to interact with existing (and future) Ergo dApps such as Sigma USD by programming the off-chain logic in a user-friendly way. Provide a \"sandbox\" mode, where users can send arbitrary scripts for execution such that the server does not have to worry about malicious programs. This enables JDE service to be hosted remotely. An example is Kiosk-Web , where you can post arbitrary scripts (such as this , which gets the reserve coin rate) in \"Tx Builder\" and obtain results. Goal #2 rules out many programming languages such as Java/Scala and Rust. In fact, this rules out all the so-called \"Turing-complete\" languages. Capabilities Let us take the use-case of purchasing, say, 10 Sigma-USD reserve coins as an example, which involves the following steps: 1. Find the current oracle pool box and obtain the rate from register R4. 2. Find the current bank box and obtain the relevant parameters (tokens in circulation and base reserves). 3. Use the formulae to obtain the delta in base-reserves. 4. Compute the details of the new bank box to be created (nano-Ergs, tokens, registers) 5. Compute the details of the new receipt box to be created (nano-Ergs, tokens, registers) 6. Make a transaction creation request to the Ergo node with above details. All the above tasks can be programmed in JDE, as done in this script . In general, JDE allows us to do the following: 1. Find some boxes by address and/or box Id 2. Extract values from those boxes (nanoErgs, registers and tokens), and define variables using those. 3. Define constant values 4. Perform computation using the constants and variables. JDE supports if-then-else construct for control flow. However, it does not support loops. 5. Define outputs using the values computed 6. Make a transaction creation request to the Ergo node How to use JDE A compiled JAR is available in the release page. You can also generate the JAR yourself using the command sbt assembly . The following are the steps in using JDE. 1. Understand the scripting language by looking at the sample scripts and the documentation. 2. Ensure you have a fully synced Ergo node running. 3.

Depending on your use-case, you will be using the output of Step 4 differently End users will use the it to send a transaction on the Ergo blockchain Wallet authors will append some of their own inputs/outputs before sending the transaction. dApp authors will use the returned values for further computation. JDE also includes a web-service mode for the last two use-cases. Please see the documentation for details. Important Notes JDE is experimental. Please use with caution at your own risk.

The moment you install any cryptocurrency wallet, you automatically create an address with it. Very loosely speaking, you can compare a wallet to a traditional bank account and an address to the matching account number. It is precisely one of these alphanumeric addresses needed to either send money from person A to person B, receive money, or withdraw your mining rewards . If you want to start using the Ergo wallet and dive deeper into its functions, check out the the following link . Now, what exactly are addresses? Addresses are short strings that correspond to specific scripts and are used to protect a box Unlike a (hex-encoded) binary representation of a script, an Ergo address use a Base58-encoding and therefore has some advantageous characteristics which the binary representation does not offer: We can quickly check the integrity of an address via an integrated checksum (which is a \"small-sized datum derived from a block of digital data to detect errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage\" according to Wikipedia). A prefix of the address shows you the network and address type. In particular, the network prefix prevents you from mistakenly sending mainnet tokens to the testnet address. The address uses an encoding (namely, Base58 as mentioned) that avoids similarly-looking characters and is friendly to double-clicking and line-breaking in emails. An address encodes network type, address type, checksum, and enough information to correspond with particular scripts. Let's look at the prefix byte, which contains information about the network and address types: Possible Types Possible network types are: Mainnet - 0x00 Testnet - 0x10 Address types are (semantics described below): 0x01 - Pay-to-PublicKey(P2PK) address 0x02 - Pay-to-Script-Hash(P2SH) 0x03 - Pay-to-Script(P2S) For an address type, we form content bytes as follows: P2PK - serialized (compressed) public key P2SH - first 192 bits of the Blake2b256 hash of serialized script bytes P2S - serialized script (this is where mining rewards go!) For example, sending 10 Ergs to a P2PK address usually means that a corresponding transaction will contain a box in which 10 Ergs are locked by a public key encoded in the P2PK address. Similarly, in the case of a P2S address, the box will be locked by a script encoded in the address. In the most complicated case of a P2SH script, the box will be protected by a special predefined script that takes the first 192 bits of Blake2b256 hash value for a script shown by an input spending the box.

Atomic Swaps enable the cross-chain exchange of digital assets, avoiding the need for centralised exchanges. Blockchains are excellent at decentralised value transfer within their domains. That is, you can send BTC to any Bitcoin address securely and efficiently, and you can send LTC to any Litecoin address securely and efficiently too. But because blockchains are based on consensus between miners, they are not designed to interface with other blockchains. Trading assets on different blockchains has, therefore, traditionally involved third parties like exchanges and OTC desks \u2013 with all the risks and inefficiencies they bring. Cross-chain swaps Atomic swaps solve this problem by enabling cryptocurrencies to be traded across blockchains. This allows the trustless exchange of assets quickly and efficiently. Here\u2019s how they work in theory: Alice and Bob agree to exchange some cryptocurrency. Alice will send Bob 1 BTC, and Bob will send Alice 50,000 ERG. Neither party trusts the other, so neither wants to send their crypto first. Alice generates a secret \u2013 a long random number \u2013 and hashes it. She then creates a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain with a script attached, locking 1 BTC and specifying a condition: when the secret (pre-image) to the hash she has created is revealed, the BTC will be sent to Bob\u2019s address. The hash can safely be included in the transaction script because the pre-image cannot be calculated. When the pre-image is revealed, 50,000 locked ERG will be sent from Bob\u2019s address to Alice\u2019s address.* Bob then similarly creates a transaction on the Ergo blockchain, including a script with the same hash Alice has used. Because Bob doesn\u2019t have the pre-image, he can\u2019t execute Alice\u2019s transaction before he has created his own. Once Alice sees that Bob has created his transaction on the Ergo blockchain, she can publish the secret and execute his transaction.

This time the audit was done by Jean-Philipee Aumasson (aka veorq, aumasson.jp/ ). The detailed report is below. Nothing critical is found. Comments on issues found: On wallet password, we'll provide a recommendation in subsequent versions of the protocol client. Not sure hard enforcement on passwords will take place, but we'll do more consultations on this. Changing \"n\" and \"k\" parameters makes sense only when launching a new network. Changing these parameters in the mining node will make blocks produced invalid for other nodes. Changing these parameters in the protocol client means going on another fork (blocks coming from the honest protocol participants will be rejected). So no need for extra checks may be, as people launching new networks will set \"n\" and \"k\" properly. Currently, the Ergo node (as well as other blockchain protocol clients and wallets we're aware of and the cryptographic libraries we're using) does not protect from side-channel attacks running locally (e.g. timing attacks or memory inspection by malware or viruses).

Ergo security assessment by Jean-Philippe Aumasson on 07/Dec/19 Summary Ergo solicited us to perform a security assessment of several components of their Ergo Platform: Sigma protocol proofs creation and verification Wallet's secure storage of secrets Proof-of-Work validation \u200bThis brief report summarises our assessment and describes our findings and mitigation recommendations. Sigma protocol proofs \u200bThe Ergo protocol relies on ErgoScript, a scripting language supporting sigma-statements, which can be proven and verified through non-interactive proofs of knowledge. These proofs are statements described as a tree of AND, OR, and threshold conditions, whose leaves are proofs of knowledge of a discrete logarithm problem. The proof of the sigma-statement is then made non-interactive thanks to the Fiat-Shamir transform. This logic is specified in the ErgoScript paper , and the specific proving and verification routines described in Appendix A. \u200bImplementation challenges are then to: Define encoding of the proofs that are safe and efficient, and implement serialisation and deserialisation that always successfully processes valid input and gracefully fails to process invalid input. Implement the proving and verification functionalities correctly, in compliance with the specification, and most importantly, no invalid statement can successfully pass verification. We reviewed these two aspects, based on the code in the repository sigmastate-interpreter , and the ErgoScript paper , carefully comparing the intended behaviour (in Appendix A) with the actual behaviour as implemented. \u200bWe notably reviewed code from the SigSerializer , Interpreter , and ProverInterpreter traits and objects. \u200bWe mainly sought bugs from the following classes: \u200bUnsafe processing of malformed input Unsafe processing of unusually long or short input Behavior when large tree depth or recursion level Unsafe use Scala types and structures Inappropriate variable types Integer overflows Race conditions Logic bugs \u200bDespite the extensive review, we did not identify any security issue. The protocol's logic and internals are relatively complex, and we believe the highest risk is in parsing and verifying proofs. To exploit such issues, however, an attacker would have to create a semantically correct script that somehow benefits them yet that passes verification when it does not ought to. Regarding software security, Scala eliminates certain classes of bugs, but Scala code may still suffer from bugs due to Scala's specific behaviour or to unhandled errors. Wallet Ergo's wallet functionality enables its users to store a secret on disk and recover it, initialising the wallet with a new seed when it's first used. \u200bThis logic is mainly defined in ErgoWalletActor , and a key component regarding secrets' storage is JsonSecretStorage . \u200bThe first time a wallet is created, the InitWallet command does the following: Generate settings.walletSettings.seedStrengthBits random bits, as initial entropy. By default , 160 bits are generated. Generate a BIP39 from the random bits generated, which can be seen as encoding the entropy bits. The standard BIP39 logic is used with an optional password. Derive a seed from the mnemonic using BIP39's PBKDF2-based derivation logic. Encrypt this seed to disk with AES-GCM, using a random nonce, and a key derives from the password using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 128000 iterations, using a random salt. To unlock a wallet already created, a user provides the password and the wallet attempts to decrypt the stored data. \u200bA similar process as initialisation is performed to restore an existing account from a BIP39 passphrase, except that the wallet will derive the seed from the mnemonic instead of picking a random mnemonic. \u200bThe two risks we identified here are: The absence of checks on the password's length: since the password is sufficient to access the seed given the wallet's on-disk stored secret, the password should, in theory, have at least as much entropy as the mnemonic, and in practice, should be practically hard to crack. We thus recommend enforcing a minimal password length, for example of 16 characters. Copies of secret values (password, seed, and derive private keys) are likely to remain in memory after wallet software execution, an intrinsic limitation of garbage-collected languages such as Scala. Another process or user sharing the same memory address space could potentially recover the secrets, and they could also appear in crash dumps. To the best of our knowledge, there is no effective mitigation in pure Scala. \u200b PoW validation \u200bAfter previously reviewing the security of the Autolykos PoW, we performed another round of review focusing on its latest verification logic, and notably, the changes in the commit eb0f85a . \u200bThe main relevant file is AutolykosPowScheme ,and other important operations are for example implemented in HeadersProcessor and ModifierValidator . \u200bWe checked that the implemented verification logic is consistent with that specified in the Autolykos specifications and that it is appropriately integrated into the block header validation logic. \u200bWe believe the following points should be addressed: Stricter validation of k and n : although the class enforces k<=32 (number of elements in the solution) and n<31 (log2 of the total number of elements), weak could still be created from the authorised parameters. The validate() function may therefore have additional validation that n and k are equal to the intended values.

The network is secure if the majority of them are honest. However, the reality becomes much more complicated than the original one-CPU-one-vote idea from the Bitcoin whitepaper. Non-Outsourceability Autolykos v1 originally had non-outsourcability built-in. However, it became apparent that it's impossible to prevent pools with smart contracts, so they turned it off so that larger players could not take advantage of the loophole. Ergo is now focusing on memory hardness to keep mining as fair as possible, which should help prevent ASICs mining at least. There are also some improvements for pooling, e.g. Stratum 2 protocol. \"Bypassing Non-Outsourceable Proof-of-Work Schemes Using Collateralized Smart Contracts\" https://ia.cr/2020/044 was presented by Alex Chepurnoy at the WTSC workshop associated with Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2020 in Malaysia. It's also discussed here on 'Unblocked with Robert Kornacki' (14:45) V2 Autolykos version two follows Autolykos v.1, but with certain modifications made: non-outsourceable puzzles were switched off. It turns out (based on more than one year of non-outsourceable PoW experience) that non-outsourceable PoW is not attractive to small miners. Now, the algorithm is trying to bind an efficient solving procedure with a single table of ~2 GB (initially), which is significantly reducing memory optimizations possibilities table size (memory requirements of a solving algorithm) grows with time The table depends solely on the block height, so there is no penalization for recalculating block candidates for the same height Basic Ideas: Like Autlykos-1, based on the k-sum problem, so a miner needs to find k (k=32) out of N (2^n = 2^26) elements and the hash of their sum must be less than the target value (inverse of the difficulty) k indexes are pseudorandom values derived from block candidate and nonce N elements are derived from block height and constants, unlike Autolykos v.1, so miners can recalculate block candidates quickly now (so only indexes are depending on them) Indexes calculation also involving the same table (which elements are last 31 bytes of H(i | | h | | M ) , where i is in [0, N), h is block height, M is padding to slow down hash calculation (8kb of constant data). So algorithm tries to make mining efficient for ones that store the table, which is 2^26 * 31 = 2,080,374,784 bytes initially (about 2GB). Thus Autolykos is now is friendly to all the GPUs. Also, table size (N value) is growing with time as follows. Until block 614,400 , N = 2^{26} = 67,108,864 elements (31 bytes each) . From this block, and until block 4,198,400 , every 51,200 blocks N is increased by 5 percent. Since block 4,198,400 , value of N is fixed and equals to 2,143,944,600 . Test vectors for N values are provided in the paper. Ergo PoW Bypassing Non-Outsourceable Proof-of-Work Schemes Using Collateralized Smart Contracts Difficulty Adjustment Ergo uses the linear least square method over 8 epoch's (each epoch is 1024 blocks x 2 minutes) described in this paper . Autolykos will adjust slowly, yes, but it is also helping to prevent adversarial hopping. Can it be quicker? Having a quicker difficulty readjustment can lead to Timewarp attacks (amongst others). Ergo is already using an epoch length of ~1.5 days (with normal block rate), not Bitcoin's two weeks. However, more epochs were considered, but the retargeting function is non-linear also so that it may adjust sooner than the linear function in certain popular scenarios. Hardforking policy Critical changes require a hard fork, but Ergo has many possibilities to evolve via soft forks; soft forkability is going further in comparison with Bitcoin. In the old generation of POW, hard forks usually lead to community splits. In Ergo, miners can change parameters on the fly in their configs, and 50%+ of blocks mined within 1024 blocks epoch need to be for raising/lowering the limit of some parameter, then it will be changed by 1% in next epoch. It can be block size, computational cost, storage fee factor and many more. The above comment for the old generation doesn't mention that core developers are also 3rd parties. With Ergo`s design, when all basic assumptions are correct, the network should adapt in time to changing environment without the intervention of any trusted parties. mx Ergo wants to avoid hard-forks. Emission, proof-of-work, the basics of the transactional model and other core things should not be changed at all as any change regarding core parts of design essentially means another chain. However, developers may propose hard-forks within the first 12 months if: A hard-fork is about security fixes only. The only exception is about making the cost of particular instructions adjustable via miners voting, which was planned but not delivered in the current mainnet. A hard-fork is supported by 90+% of miners. A hard-fork is not breaking old contracts, freezing or moving any funds. Decentralisation While most active conversations today in the space are about wider adoption of the blockchain technology (which often includes selling out to Wall St.) and competition with systems like Visa and Mastercard (which often means giving up with Decentralisation or introducing unclear security assumptions in the name of efficiency), there is the obvious need to revisit the roots of the cryptocurrency movement, which are mostly about Decentralisation. Many questions to be answered clear here. Is it okay when 90% of mining power in Bitcoin can gather in one room ? - Is it okay when 2 or 3 mining pools control the majority of hashing power, so can censorship? - Is it okay when almost all the new nodes avoid processing a blockchain from its genesis block? - Is it okay when Proof-of-Work coin developers are doing a hard-fork changing the consensus algorithm to make it GPU-friendly again? - Can we summarize all the issues with Decentralisation? - Can we cover most of the issues with technical means? Decentralisation is about many issues lying in many fields, of technical, social, and hybrid kinds. Researchers and developers are trying to find technical solutions, preferably elegant and efficient. However, for many issues, such solutions are not known; thus, social solutions are also needed. 51% Attacks Mining pools offer a buffer against such network attacks as the hash rate is distributed across thousands of individual miners. Ergo's memory-hardened aspect also makes this vector of attack more expensive as there is no ASIC support to rent. With the collective rentable rigs at the moment, this isn't a viable path to a 51% attack. In theory, someone could build a massive GPU farm to try to launch such an attack. If a bad actor can rent a warehouse of ASIC and mine on a small chain with 51% attacks are a viable option... if there is an offramp. This attack is usually performed for profit and results in massive dumping on an exchange as it is occurring. Meaning the attacker will dump tokens on an exchange than \"double-spend\" them back into their wallet. The current exchange situation doesn't provide the liquidity for a viable offramp. The rentable ASIC support isn't an option. So is it possible, in theory, yes, practical or likely? I don't think so at all. Ethereum classic is perhaps a bad example, as it shares the same mining algorithm as Eth. One could buy more than 100% current hash rate of eth classic on NiceHash. It's not the same case for Ergo. Ergo also believes in the 'Good Miner' principle; in the case of Bitcoin - it was a good thing 51% existed. Decentralisation of Mining The two biggest concerns about decentralising mining are specialized hardware (such as ASICs) and centralized pools. With ASICs, a big player capable of investing enough money into R&D can get an unfair advantage from privately owned efficient hardware. In principle, for any computational activity, it is always possible to develop specialized hardware performing better than commodity computing units, such and CPUs and GPUs. However, for different computational tasks, R&D efforts and the possible outcome could vary a lot. The reasoning behind a search for a perfect (or close enough to perfect) could be quite complex (see, e.g. 30 pages long Equihash paper ). For most Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash), 2 to 4 centralized mining pools control most mining power. This could mean easy censorship or frontrunning on applications (for example, reordering exchange orders), as in centralized pools, only the pool decides block candidate for the whole pool to work on. As a possible outcome, non-outsourceable mining schemes can prevent centralized pools formation. Only Ergo Platform is known for deploying a practical non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work scheme (based on a supposedly memory-harder problem from the Equihash paper ) called Autolykos . As an example where social Decentralisation issues meet the Decentralisation of mining, sometimes developers of Proof-of-Work is introducing hard-forks to make a Proof-of-Work algorithm GPU-friendly again once ASICs are going to dominate in the mining market for the coin; however, it is always not quite clear why legitimate activity is banned and why developers (along with some users) can do hard-fork for this particular reason. Decentralisation of Verification Decentralisation of verification is about the possibility to check the validity of blockchain history. Such a check provides confidence that nothing bad (i.e. not conforming to a protocol) was injected into the blockchain. Thus, it gave a user a right to reject malicious chain even if it has absorbed more work than alternatives. There were many talks about such the right in the Bitcoin community when it was partly hot about User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) idea, and a recent article \"Who secures Bitcoin?\" is summarizing this way of thinking well. If verification can be done in reasonable time only by an entity able to spend millions on renting a data centre, a network is not decentralized. Ideally, it should be possible to check the integrity of the whole blockchain on commodity hardware, like a decent laptop. However, new blockchains also tend to absorb more and more features, and they are not coming for free. Then the huge topic in the research community is about how to make it possible to check the integrity of the whole blockchain with pruned blocks or system state (or both) under plausible assumptions. Possible solutions here are about bootstrapping state snapshot and blockchain suffix on top of it (popular in Ethereum protocol clients, and formalized in an academic paper even ), stateless clients ( partially stateless , as implemented in Ergo Platform or fully stateless which do exist only in research papers currently).

In Ergo, miners can change parameters on the fly in their configs, and 50%+ of blocks mined within 1024 blocks epoch need to be for raising/lowering the limit of some parameter, then it will be changed by 1% in next epoch. It can be block size, computational cost, storage fee factor and many more. The above comment for the old generation doesn't mention that core developers are also 3rd parties. With Ergo`s design, when all basic assumptions are correct, the network should adapt in time to changing environment without the intervention of any trusted parties. mx Ergo wants to avoid hard-forks. Emission, proof-of-work, the basics of the transactional model and other core things should not be changed at all as any change regarding core parts of design essentially means another chain. However, developers may propose hard-forks within the first 12 months if: A hard-fork is about security fixes only. The only exception is about making the cost of particular instructions adjustable via miners voting, which was planned but not delivered in the current mainnet. A hard-fork is supported by 90+% of miners. A hard-fork is not breaking old contracts, freezing or moving any funds.","title":"Hardforking policy"},{"location":"dev/protocol/autolykos/#decentralisation","text":"While most active conversations today in the space are about wider adoption of the blockchain technology (which often includes selling out to Wall St.) and competition with systems like Visa and Mastercard (which often means giving up with Decentralisation or introducing unclear security assumptions in the name of efficiency), there is the obvious need to revisit the roots of the cryptocurrency movement, which are mostly about Decentralisation. Many questions to be answered clear here. Is it okay when 90% of mining power in Bitcoin can gather in one room ? - Is it okay when 2 or 3 mining pools control the majority of hashing power, so can censorship? - Is it okay when almost all the new nodes avoid processing a blockchain from its genesis block? - Is it okay when Proof-of-Work coin developers are doing a hard-fork changing the consensus algorithm to make it GPU-friendly again? - Can we summarize all the issues with Decentralisation? - Can we cover most of the issues with technical means? Decentralisation is about many issues lying in many fields, of technical, social, and hybrid kinds.

Ergo's memory-hardened aspect also makes this vector of attack more expensive as there is no ASIC support to rent. With the collective rentable rigs at the moment, this isn't a viable path to a 51% attack. In theory, someone could build a massive GPU farm to try to launch such an attack. If a bad actor can rent a warehouse of ASIC and mine on a small chain with 51% attacks are a viable option... if there is an offramp. This attack is usually performed for profit and results in massive dumping on an exchange as it is occurring. Meaning the attacker will dump tokens on an exchange than \"double-spend\" them back into their wallet. The current exchange situation doesn't provide the liquidity for a viable offramp. The rentable ASIC support isn't an option. So is it possible, in theory, yes, practical or likely? I don't think so at all. Ethereum classic is perhaps a bad example, as it shares the same mining algorithm as Eth. One could buy more than 100% current hash rate of eth classic on NiceHash. It's not the same case for Ergo.

With ASICs, a big player capable of investing enough money into R&D can get an unfair advantage from privately owned efficient hardware. In principle, for any computational activity, it is always possible to develop specialized hardware performing better than commodity computing units, such and CPUs and GPUs. However, for different computational tasks, R&D efforts and the possible outcome could vary a lot. The reasoning behind a search for a perfect (or close enough to perfect) could be quite complex (see, e.g. 30 pages long Equihash paper ). For most Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash), 2 to 4 centralized mining pools control most mining power. This could mean easy censorship or frontrunning on applications (for example, reordering exchange orders), as in centralized pools, only the pool decides block candidate for the whole pool to work on. As a possible outcome, non-outsourceable mining schemes can prevent centralized pools formation. Only Ergo Platform is known for deploying a practical non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work scheme (based on a supposedly memory-harder problem from the Equihash paper ) called Autolykos . As an example where social Decentralisation issues meet the Decentralisation of mining, sometimes developers of Proof-of-Work is introducing hard-forks to make a Proof-of-Work algorithm GPU-friendly again once ASICs are going to dominate in the mining market for the coin; however, it is always not quite clear why legitimate activity is banned and why developers (along with some users) can do hard-fork for this particular reason.","title":"Decentralisation of Mining"},{"location":"dev/protocol/autolykos/#decentralisation-of-verification","text":"Decentralisation of verification is about the possibility to check the validity of blockchain history. Such a check provides confidence that nothing bad (i.e. not conforming to a protocol) was injected into the blockchain.

There were many talks about such the right in the Bitcoin community when it was partly hot about User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) idea, and a recent article \"Who secures Bitcoin?\" is summarizing this way of thinking well. If verification can be done in reasonable time only by an entity able to spend millions on renting a data centre, a network is not decentralized. Ideally, it should be possible to check the integrity of the whole blockchain on commodity hardware, like a decent laptop. However, new blockchains also tend to absorb more and more features, and they are not coming for free. Then the huge topic in the research community is about how to make it possible to check the integrity of the whole blockchain with pruned blocks or system state (or both) under plausible assumptions.

That means DeFi interoperability will be critical. Despite the open source nature of the blockchain world, crypto projects have always tended to have an \u2018us-and-them\u2019 mentality. The assumption is that for one platform to succeed, it must be at the expense of all the others. Hence marketing strategies that position one or other platform as the \u2018Ethereum killer\u2019, and other such claims. The reality is quite different, as 2020 should have proven beyond doubt. New DeFi projects bring users and volume to each other; composability is important because it allows dApps to provide reciprocal benefits and build mutual network effect. So why should the blockchain platforms themselves be any different? Seamless interoperability To date, different blockchains are still relatively siloed. It\u2019s possible to plug different blockchains into each other, but it\u2019s not nearly as easy as it is to do with dApps on the same platform. But what if that was different? What if true cross-blockchain composability was possible? That would truly be a game changer, since it would no longer matter which platform developers launched their dApps on. At present, the majority of developers choose Ethereum because that\u2019s where the users and volume are. Opting for a different blockchain might make sense on technical grounds, but you then risk having a well-functioning dApp with a fraction of the potential user base. If blockchains were fully interoperable, developers could make their infrastructure choices based on their preferred programming language and other technical criteria, knowing that the users would come from all over the blockchain space, whatever network the dApp was hosted on. Blockchain agnostic dApps, powered by Ergo This is the future that Ergo would like to see and bring about. Each blockchain platform will have its own strengths, but all will be interoperable, meaning that tokens and dApps will be able to cross the chasm to other chains where desired. This allows Ergo to focus on its core features, such as Sigma Protocols, rather than seek shortcuts to adoption like yield farming projects. The use of the Gravity Protocol will enable interoperability between Ergo and other participating blockchains, while Ergo\u2019s unique features will be available to everyone. How might this look in practice? Here\u2019s just one potential use case. Imagine a project raises funds via a crowdsale. It makes sense that cash should be raised in BTC, among other currencies, since this is the largest community and pool of funds. But Bitcoin does not offer the optimal way to administrate and disburse the money. Using Ergo\u2019s ZK Treasury , an address is created with bespoke conditions. A team of seven people needs to create a digital signature to access the funds. Five of seven accounts need to sign a transaction, or else the CEO, CTO and CFO together. BTC is then locked in a bridge to the Ergo blockchain, so that an equal amount of BTC proxy tokens on Ergo (much like RenBTC on Ethereum) are deposited to the treasury account. The team can disburse funds from this account, and either use ErgBTC on the Ergo chain, or unlock them on Bitcoin to pay for development and marketing. This allows the developers to add Ergo\u2019s benefits of Sigma Protocols and custom signatures to Bitcoin. In another version of this use case, an address might be created using multi-party computation using Ergo, such that no private key actually exists at all. A signature can be created using Ergo, and then used to push a transaction to a separate blockchain (e.g. Ethereum). This allows Ergo to be used as a layer for highly secure account creation and transaction management on other networks. This is just one possibility that seamless interoperability raises. There will be many more that we look forward to exploring as Gravity and additional protocols come online.","title":"Interoperability"},{"location":"dev/protocol/nipopow/","text":"NiPoPoWs Ergo implements NiPoPoWs, or Non-interactive Proof-of-Proof-of-Work.

For example, these proofs can illustrate that a cryptocurrency payment was made. Blocks In Ergo, just like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains, blocks are broken into sections. In Bitcoin, there's simply a block header and the transactions themselves. But in Ergo, we have some extra sections that enable new functionality: Header Transactions Extensions Proofs of UTXO transformation The 'extension' section contains certain mandatory fields (including links for NiPoPoW, once per 1,024 block epoch) and parameters for miner voting, such as current block size. It can also contain arbitrary fields. What this means in practice is that different types of nodes and clients can download only those sections of the blocks they need \u2013 reducing the demands for storage, bandwidth, and CPU cycles. Light Full Nodes While miners need to download everything, lite full nodes only need the transactions and proofs. This means they have a cryptographic guarantee of transactions without holding the complete UTXO set itself. Lite full nodes check the proofs generated by full nodes (including miners) who hold the whole blockchain, guaranteeing ledger validity. In Ethereum, these nodes are called Stateless Clients. For Ergo, it means you can run a full node and maintain the network with a device as simple as a Raspberry Pi with 512 MB RAM.

You might want to run a full node. If you're a miner, this will require that you download the entire blockchain because you'll need the whole UTXO (unspent outputs) set to mine new blocks. But you can still run a full node without that UTXO set \u2013 vastly reducing the specification and expense of the hardware needed. Light Clients Light Clients are essential when considering the hurdles cryptocurrency faces with mass adoption. Most crypto users do not have the necessary tools to run a full node. Running a full node means having a strong processor with high electricity wattage and more than a hundred gigabytes of memory to store the entire blockchain. Light clients are useful because they enable verification with a limited supply of data providers (nodes) and significantly reduce the amount of data storage and bandwidth needed for everyday users. The use of light clients with the implementation of NIPoPoWs makes it possible to interact with the blockchain through block headers by using only a couple of kilobytes. Verifying whether a transaction happened on the blockchain becomes simplified. NIPoPoWs can help people interact with the blockchain by using more efficient and convenient mobile wallets. NIPoPoWs allow very efficient mobile wallets to be created. SPV wallets are already very lightweight compared to full nodes because they only require the download of block headers, not the whole blockchain. NIPoPoW wallets need to download only a small sample of block headers, around 250, when SPV clients need to download half a million block headers. The sample needed changes but doesn't grow much in size as the blockchain grows larger over the years, even after decades of data has been accumulated. This enables Ergo to build a mobile SPV client that requires around just 100KB of block headers to be downloaded. SPV Security There's often tension in the crypto world between security and convenience. That trade-off is unacceptable if we want these technologies to be widely used. Here's how Ergo addresses one common and critical issue.* We all know that the most secure way to use Bitcoin, or any crypto, is to download a copy of the blockchain and run a full node yourself. That way, every time you or anyone else makes a transaction, your client checks the blockchain to ensure it's valid. You don't have to trust anyone else. A full Bitcoin node checks all the blocks in the blockchain (using headers) and makes sure there are no fraudulent transactions. It's a very secure way of using crypto \u2013 but there's a problem. It requires significant bandwidth, storage, and processing power. That kind of commodity hardware is expensive, and using a full node to validate and make transactions is in any case unsuitable for mobile devices. This is particularly true for Bitcoin, where the blockchain is over 270 GB and counting . Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) is designed to address this problem, as described in the Bitcoin white paper : It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it and blocks added after it further confirms the network has accepted it. Satoshi notes that this is not a perfect solution and is vulnerable to an attacker overpowering the network and fooling SPV users. Moreover, while SPV mode is intended for resource-limited devices, even this 'lite' approach is not always feasible. Ethereum's headers alone total around 5 GB to download. Thus Ethereum mobile clients do not validate chain validity and so blindly have to trust third parties. There are proposals to reduce the requirements for SPV mode by checking just a few random headers instead of all of them. But it's hard to do that securely. Efficient SPV Several years have been spent researching and developing secure protocols that allow for efficient SPV clients. The two best-known and most reliable protocols are NiPoPoWs and FlyClient. Ergo implements NiPoPoWs, or Non-interactive Proof-of-Proof-of-Work.

Log-Space Mining Dionysis Zindros explains the technical landscape of Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work. Dionysis takes a diligent approach for the Ergo Cast with a detailed rundown of what Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work truly are. Furthermore, Dionysis evaluates the operation, implementation, and impact that his primitive delivers upon. Furthermore, we unveil a brand-new piece of research that -as of yet- has never been shared publicly: log-space mining. NiPoPoWs & Log-Space Mining \u2013 Ergo Cast Episode #5 This section is based on a recently published article by IOHK. For an additional resource, please see the following video. Whether it is Ergo, Bitcoin, or another PoW consensus model, miners must constantly maintain the blockchain. In addition to using computational resources, miners also use storage resources that maintain all blockchain data from the genesis block. A new miner's problem: Is downloading all the data from the genesis block strictly necessary? Why is it not possible to download only the most relevant blocks to maintain the network? The block headers of the blockchain should be enough to access the necessary data. NIPoPoWs (Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work) can be integrated to form interlinked block header sets that will reduce historical data storage. When needing to access key blocks in the blockchain, miners should be able to efficiently do this from the headers of the old blocks. That is because each new block must indicate all of the current networks. As new blocks are created, a set of new block headers can be enough to check for the current UTXO set. Since the new blocks contain the data of old stringed block header sets, it enables light mining by eliminating the need to download all the blockchain data. What are we trying to optimize by stringing old PoW history and compiling it into a snapshot? If we say C=old blocks and K=new blocks, then included blocks in the snapshot can be growing when K=new blocks are constant, and C=old blocks are linear. But it can also be shrinking depending on the smart contract applications. The problem of maintaining heavy loads of data by the miners can be solved by bootstrapping through NIPoPoWs. NIPoPoW Implementation Instead of accessing all of the blocks, superblocks (or light-clients) are enough to verify all of the blocks. This is accomplished by maintaining the historical data of the blockchain through smart contracts. The introduction of these superblock clients on NIPoPoWs can be done via 'velvet' or soft forks, and after that \"light\" miners can bootstrap through \"online\" mining. NIPoPoWs enable smart contracts to maintain historical data so that new \"light\" miners can work in a so-called \"online\" fashion. This is the main idea of Logarithmic Space Mining, where instead of saving all the blockchain data locally on nodes, the unnecessary part of it can be compiled into the blockchain itself. New miners do not need to carry the historical data, and as they continue to mine, new \"light\" miners will help other \"light\" miners bootstrap. There will be no need to carry old historical data, and old miners can abandon historical data for lighter mining. This is how the whole miner population can abandon old blocks and make the system much more efficient. Sidechains Another implementation is cross-chain communication with Proof of Stake networks. PoS networks such as Cardano can interact with Ergo through NIPoPoW integration. Such verification schemes can erase the need for centralized DAO structures and create new non-interactive cross-chain operations. To put it simply, NiPoPoWs act as sidechains. Two or more separate chains can integrate through NiPoPoWs without the need for change in other chains. Such integration would erase the need for, for example, \"Wrapped Tokens,\" tokens that rely on DAO governance. NIPoPoW is a robust tool in creating blockchain networks and provides easier access to clients. They're also helpful in enhancing scalability by creating Layer 2 organizations. Side chains , on the other hand, are a completely different component of blockchain. They are beneficial for various elements such as private chains, scalability improvement, and cross-chain interoperability. Kushti mentioned that he will release a sidechain \"cookbook,\" entitled Ergo-Meta, in the following months. One application of NIPoPoWs that we have described in a previous article deals with logarithmic space mining . Logarithmic space mining allows for \"light miners.\" Similar to light clients, light miners can bootstrap with block headers without downloading the whole blockchain. It is also possible to store just a few necessary blocks to verify the whole blockchain in a blockchain. This essentially eradicates the need for miners to store all of the blockchains. Integrating logarithmic space mining in Ergo is possible via velvet (soft) forks, therefore preventing the need for painful hard forks. Another application of NIPoPoWs was proposed in the first ErgoHack by a team called SmartPools. SmartPools' proposal aims to increase the Nakamoto Coefficient , a metric for calculating the decentralization of the given network. In our case, the proposal aims to increase the decentralization of the Ergo Platform by bootstrapping mining entities with collateralized smart contracts. The purpose here is to provide returns for non-miner investors and prevent big GPU farms from taking control of the system. The most well-known example of NIPoPoWs is the implementation of the second layer blockchain. Second layers are helpful in interacting with different blockchains by increasing scalability and creating private sidechains for enterprise-grade applications. Second layers create blockchains on top of the primary blockchain for different use cases. Because transactions can happen on these second layers without constant synchronous updates, the network load can be lowered substantially by keeping everything on the main chain all the time. The Ergo blockchain has supported NIPoPoWs since its genesis, yet their use cases are still in their infancy. We continue to develop this field of research with our partners at IOHK and EMURGO , and we expect their application to increase with continued contributions from the community developers.","title":"NIPoPoWS"},{"location":"dev/protocol/nipopow/#nipopows","text":"Ergo implements NiPoPoWs, or Non-interactive Proof-of-Proof-of-Work.

The sample needed changes but doesn't grow much in size as the blockchain grows more extensive over the years, even after accumulated decades of data. This enables us to build a mobile SPV client that requires around just 100KB of block headers to be downloaded. A super-efficient Ergo wallet with SPV security is in development, so stay tuned for more updates!","title":"Efficient SPV"},{"location":"dev/protocol/nipopow/#log-space-mining","text":"Dionysis Zindros explains the technical landscape of Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work. Dionysis takes a diligent approach for the Ergo Cast with a detailed rundown of what Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work truly are. Furthermore, Dionysis evaluates the operation, implementation, and impact that his primitive delivers upon. Furthermore, we unveil a brand-new piece of research that -as of yet- has never been shared publicly: log-space mining. NiPoPoWs & Log-Space Mining \u2013 Ergo Cast Episode #5 This section is based on a recently published article by IOHK. For an additional resource, please see the following video. Whether it is Ergo, Bitcoin, or another PoW consensus model, miners must constantly maintain the blockchain. In addition to using computational resources, miners also use storage resources that maintain all blockchain data from the genesis block. A new miner's problem: Is downloading all the data from the genesis block strictly necessary? Why is it not possible to download only the most relevant blocks to maintain the network? The block headers of the blockchain should be enough to access the necessary data. NIPoPoWs (Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work) can be integrated to form interlinked block header sets that will reduce historical data storage. When needing to access key blocks in the blockchain, miners should be able to efficiently do this from the headers of the old blocks. That is because each new block must indicate all of the current networks. As new blocks are created, a set of new block headers can be enough to check for the current UTXO set. Since the new blocks contain the data of old stringed block header sets, it enables light mining by eliminating the need to download all the blockchain data. What are we trying to optimize by stringing old PoW history and compiling it into a snapshot? If we say C=old blocks and K=new blocks, then included blocks in the snapshot can be growing when K=new blocks are constant, and C=old blocks are linear. But it can also be shrinking depending on the smart contract applications. The problem of maintaining heavy loads of data by the miners can be solved by bootstrapping through NIPoPoWs. NIPoPoW Implementation Instead of accessing all of the blocks, superblocks (or light-clients) are enough to verify all of the blocks. This is accomplished by maintaining the historical data of the blockchain through smart contracts. The introduction of these superblock clients on NIPoPoWs can be done via 'velvet' or soft forks, and after that \"light\" miners can bootstrap through \"online\" mining. NIPoPoWs enable smart contracts to maintain historical data so that new \"light\" miners can work in a so-called \"online\" fashion. This is the main idea of Logarithmic Space Mining, where instead of saving all the blockchain data locally on nodes, the unnecessary part of it can be compiled into the blockchain itself. New miners do not need to carry the historical data, and as they continue to mine, new \"light\" miners will help other \"light\" miners bootstrap. There will be no need to carry old historical data, and old miners can abandon historical data for lighter mining. This is how the whole miner population can abandon old blocks and make the system much more efficient.","title":"Log-Space Mining"},{"location":"dev/protocol/nipopow/#sidechains","text":"Another implementation is cross-chain communication with Proof of Stake networks. PoS networks such as Cardano can interact with Ergo through NIPoPoW integration. Such verification schemes can erase the need for centralized DAO structures and create new non-interactive cross-chain operations. To put it simply, NiPoPoWs act as sidechains. Two or more separate chains can integrate through NiPoPoWs without the need for change in other chains. Such integration would erase the need for, for example, \"Wrapped Tokens,\" tokens that rely on DAO governance. NIPoPoW is a robust tool in creating blockchain networks and provides easier access to clients. They're also helpful in enhancing scalability by creating Layer 2 organizations. Side chains , on the other hand, are a completely different component of blockchain. They are beneficial for various elements such as private chains, scalability improvement, and cross-chain interoperability. Kushti mentioned that he will release a sidechain \"cookbook,\" entitled Ergo-Meta, in the following months. One application of NIPoPoWs that we have described in a previous article deals with logarithmic space mining . Logarithmic space mining allows for \"light miners.\" Similar to light clients, light miners can bootstrap with block headers without downloading the whole blockchain. It is also possible to store just a few necessary blocks to verify the whole blockchain in a blockchain. This essentially eradicates the need for miners to store all of the blockchains. Integrating logarithmic space mining in Ergo is possible via velvet (soft) forks, therefore preventing the need for painful hard forks. Another application of NIPoPoWs was proposed in the first ErgoHack by a team called SmartPools. SmartPools' proposal aims to increase the Nakamoto Coefficient , a metric for calculating the decentralization of the given network. In our case, the proposal aims to increase the decentralization of the Ergo Platform by bootstrapping mining entities with collateralized smart contracts. The purpose here is to provide returns for non-miner investors and prevent big GPU farms from taking control of the system. The most well-known example of NIPoPoWs is the implementation of the second layer blockchain. Second layers are helpful in interacting with different blockchains by increasing scalability and creating private sidechains for enterprise-grade applications. Second layers create blockchains on top of the primary blockchain for different use cases. Because transactions can happen on these second layers without constant synchronous updates, the network load can be lowered substantially by keeping everything on the main chain all the time. The Ergo blockchain has supported NIPoPoWs since its genesis, yet their use cases are still in their infancy. We continue to develop this field of research with our partners at IOHK and EMURGO , and we expect their application to increase with continued contributions from the community developers.","title":"Sidechains"},{"location":"dev/protocol/rent/","text":"Participate in community discussions - Ergo Emission: details, retargeting via a soft-fork We\u2019ve designed Ergo with long-term economic sustainability in mind, and storage rent is one of the ways we\u2019re ensuring miners stay profitable well into the future. One community member, Robert, describes this function as \u2018on-chain garbage collection\u2019 that reduces the problem of blockchain bloat \u2013 and even makes it profitable. The 2020 block reward reduction will probably be the most important halving Bitcoin ever experiences. This is the point where the narrative of programmatic scarcity and digital gold will truly be proven, in the context of the sharpest economic downturn in living memory. In previous halvings, Bitcoin has still been in its infancy, a niche experiment. Future halvings will confirm the principle. But this one is the watershed. Looking ahead, though, what happens in 20 or 30 years, when block rewards have fallen so far that miners have to rely on tx fees and potentially other sources of revenue? Will Bitcoin be sustainable? What will be the impact on the ecosystem? The simple answer is that we don\u2019t know. Mining rewards are a key feature in maintaining the security of proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ergo. And so, while we have deliberately kept many of Bitcoin\u2019s tried and tested features, we have updated this one to give miners a boost when block rewards have fallen to zero. Lost coins Digital scarcity is an important feature of Ergo. Like Bitcoin, ERG are designed to be a finite resource and long-term store of value. We do not agree with the principle of infinite inflation. And yet, this has to be balanced against the needs to pay miners to secure the blockchain and process transactions. Without adequate compensation for miners, there is no viable blockchain at all. Ergo approaches this by slowly recycling lost coins, in a feature we call \u2018Storage rent\u2019. Studies suggest that as many as 4 million BTC may have been lost forever . These are coins that were mined in the early days of Bitcoin and stored on hard drives that were subsequently thrown away or destroyed because the owners forgot about them or thought they were worthless, as well as coins in addresses for which the private keys have been lost. (And, of course, there\u2019s Satoshi\u2019s estimated holdings of 1 million BTC, which may never move.) Where coins have genuinely been permanently taken out of circulation in this way, it makes sense to have a mechanism to recover them and put them back into the blockchain economy. That way, we can preserve digital scarcity without unnecessarily accelerating it. In other words, by attempting to stick to the intended algorithmic supply for any given point in time. Ergo\u2019s halving schedule is faster than Bitcoin\u2019s. Block rewards start at 75 ERG, and decrease steadily after the first two years. There is no \u2018long tail\u2019 of emission, and after eight years block rewards will fall to zero. After that, total supply will be fixed. The number of ERG in existence will never be more than 97,739,925. Storage fees From that point, however, miners will need further incentives to secure the network. Miners have ongoing costs in terms of bandwidth and storage, and in cases where coins are simply left for years, there is typically no charge for reflecting the value of securing them. The tx fee that is paid up-front in Bitcoin is the only charge ever made for storing those coins. In Ergo, in addition to transaction fees, miners will also be able to collect storage rent fees on UTXOs that have not been moved for four years or more. Fees will be deducted slowly, over time \u2013 the unmoved UTXOs will not simply be appropriated by miners. Anyone who wants to avoid this simply needs to move their balances once every four years, which is not an onerous requirement for helping incentivise miners and avoiding the deflationary consequences of lost coins. You can read more about how fees will be levied in this paper . In this way, Ergo seeks to ensure a balance between maintaining digital scarcity, on the one hand, and giving miners long-term incentives to secure the blockchain, on the other \u2013 long past the point where new coins have ceased to be released. This article is a continuation and summarization of A Systematic Approach To Cryptocurrency Fees (hereinafter referred to as the paper) by Alex (Kushti) Chepurnoy, Vasily Kharin and Dmitry Meshkov. In the paper, the authors address the problem of storage resources utilization. There is a concern that once an element of the state is created, it exists forever and inevitably balloons node disk space. This will lead to unreasonable state growth of the blockchain. While cryptocurrencies address transaction fees as an atomic concept, the paper suggests that it is reasonable to take this into account on a 3-dimensional scale. Blockchain Costs Proof of Work blockchain technology relies on miners to guard the integrity of the blockchain. Miner resources, such as memory and electricity, are costly and therefore a revenue scheme is needed to incentivize miners. Miner incentives are currently comprised of the block rewards and transaction fees. Transactions fees are an important component in preventing spam attacks that exhaust miner resources. Besides network utilization, transaction processing requires a miner to spend resources to maintain all the original blockchain data. In the case of Bitcoin, this might be less of a problem because it has yet to implement smart contract functionality. Cryptocurrencies that support smart contract languages such as Solidity (Ethereum) however, may require a lot of computations and corresponding costs will be included in the transaction fee. The 3-dimensional scale shown above is based on storage-oriented load, computational load and network load. Storage-oriented load refers to the additional cost of storing old data in the blockchain. Computational load is created by the execution of smart contracts. Network load is all the transactions that do not exist in the current block but will be added to the next block. In Ergo, the total size of the state is the sum of the sizes of all UTXOs. That is to say that this data contains the execution of smart contracts, all the transactions and nodal information. Because the memory resources provided by miners are limited, a state deterioration fee should be added to miners' revenue streams in order to encourage decreasing the system load while securing future miners\u2019 contribution. Storage Rent Unreasonable state growth is an economic problem and it can lead to spam attacks and network congestion. Another problem could be the deflation of a cryptocurrency if coins are lost and/or forgotten. So instead of being used as the base for smart contracts, the currency becomes unreasonably scarce, making the system heavy and limiting coin flow. This leads to a perpetually increasing state (e.g. the Bitcoin\u2019s total UTXO size) and the state may grow faster during spam attacks. For example, 15 million outputs were created during spam attacks against Bitcoin in July 2015. An attack on Ethereum created 18 million new accounts added to the state - which previously held only 1 million - and performed successful \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks against the nodes. To tackle the problem of unreasonable state growth, a \"storage rent\" fee is proposed by the paper. Storage rent is a scheduled fee that is based on the continuation of each UTXO created in the blockchain. This is achieved by the use of scheduled payments, which will eradicate the unused bytes after a certain time. Additionally, the use of blockchains as cloud storage is gaining attraction, so permanently storing objects in the state without some form of recirculation procedure of the old data is not a plausible option. For the purposes of research and this article, it is worth noting that the concept of storage rent was also proposed in 2014 by Freicoin : \u201cDemurrage forces freicoins to circulate at deliberately high rates. Separation of money's roles as store-of-value and medium-of-exchange allows money to flow when it is needed, in good times and bad.\u201c Conclusions An important consequence of storage fees is that they provide additional rewards (besides block and transaction rewards) for miners. Storage fees decrease the storage load and eliminate extra costs that could be added during unreasonable state growth. Storage fees encourage coin flow and prevent deflation, which can cause illiquidity and the congestion of a currency system.

The UTXO model is criticially different from the Account model via the concept of \"boxes\" we introduce for data-keeping. In the Accounts model, there is a single account where you receive your coins. In the UTXO model, however, every tx (transaction) creates a new box, and your balance is the sum of all the boxes linked to your addresses. To be clear, your Yoroi private key can consist of more than one box in a single address to hold your coins. As you generate a new address, you will create a secondary box to hold your coins. After it is created, you can send funds to this new address, and your funds will be seen as one with your private key. You can create an infinite number of new boxes to hold your coins. As such, every receiving and spending action will also create an additional unique box. This feature can create misconceptions by the user at first glance. When you make a transaction, the network scans your \"boxes\" to verify if you have your tokens and then initiates the transaction. Things get complex after this point because you can not guess which boxes are going to be spent. Imagine you have three different receiving addresses. You received a couple of coins in each of them, and you want to spend some of your coins. In a Yoroi wallet, you can hold any Ergo native coins such as SigRSV or SigUSD. When you initiate a transaction that accesses the boxes of these coins, you will see that they are taken away and then redeposited. Recently, an Ergonaut raised the following question : \"I just created a Yoroi Nightly wallet. I transferred 31 Erg from my main Yoroi wallet to the Yoroi Nightly wallet. The transaction shows 31 Erg plus a small fee, 0.0011. But it also says +92,000 SigRSV. My balance shows no change in SigRSV. What is the meaning of the +92,000 SigRSV in the transaction?\" Let's take a look at the details of this particular transaction : To make a transaction of '31 ERG`, the wallet selected three of the boxes with ERG: A box containing 0.029595 ERG that was received on 07/19/21 A second box containing 19.76 ERG that was received on 07/19/21 A third box containing 208.26 ERG that was received on 06/09/21 On the left section of the image above, you will see approximately 228 ERG taken, while on the right section, you will see 31 ERG sent and 197 ERG redeposited to your wallet. So your wallet used three of your boxes to spend the desired amount. This action includes all the assets in that box to the transaction. After the desired amount is spent, your funds are simply refunded to your address in a newly created UTXO box or boxes. Therefore, spending any coin in a box means spending the whole box and creating a new UTXO box, which is why you see your tokens are taken away and then redeposited. The selection of which boxes to spend is a secret of the wallet's random selection strategy. Whatever coins are in the selected boxes, be it SigRSV, SigUSD or NFT, will be displayed as per the example. Summary The Accounts model contains a single box, and this box is not spent. It remains the same so that non-related coins will remain unaffected. The UTXO model, on the other hand, contains a set of boxes that represents the total amount of the user's balance and the unspent transaction output has to change with each spending transaction. You may see a long list of tokens when swapping just 5 SigRSV as below: This is how UTXO model Transaction works - its storage is different from the Accounts model. In the UTXO model, coins will be stored in one-use UTXO boxes and not in long-living accounts. Anatomy of an Ergo transaction One or more Input boxes (source of funds). These boxes must already exist and will be destroyed. The guard script in each of these boxes will be evaluated and must return true for the transaction to be considered valid, One or more Output boxes (destination of funds). These boxes will be created. Zero or more Data-Inputs boxes. These are additional boxes whose data can be referenced and used by smart contracts of the inputs. The guard script in these boxes will not be evaluated. Data inputs are unique to Ergo and not yet present in other extended-UTXO systems. Multiple transactions can share a data-input box, and it will store only a single reference to the box in the block. We can also spend a data-input box in the same transaction as long as it existed before the transaction was applied. As an example, the box with id d2b9b6536287b242f436436ce5a1e4a117d7b4843a13ce3abe3168bff99924a1 was used as both an input and a data-input in this transaction. While the use of data-inputs may not be immediately apparent, they play a major role in making Ergo more friendly to DeFi applications where we want to refer to a box without needing (or having the ability) to spend it such as in decentralized order-books (DEX).

While that might on the surface limit code complexity, it\u2019s nevertheless possible to create Turing-complete scripts by iterating processes across multiple blocks.

Sigma protocols The platform is unashamedly conservative, basing as many features as possible on Bitcoin \u2013 after all, Bitcoin is the most battle-tested crypto network in existence. Ergo\u2019s UTXO model, PoW mining and finite supply draw on Bitcoin\u2019s approaches to consensus and economic incentives. But Ergo also incorporates cutting-edge research into new cryptographic processes, using Sigma protocols to enable DeFi applications that would be either complex and messy or simply impossible on other platforms. Sigma protocols are a well-known class of zero-knowledge proofs that allow developers to implement very powerful processes very elegantly. For example, what if you want to build a privacy service that allows any one of a dozen different accounts to spend funds from an address \u2013 but no one can tell who has made each transfer? Such a \u2018ring contract\u2019 is possible with Ethereum, but it would require a clunky and expensive workaround. With Ergo\u2019s Sigma protocols, it\u2019s possible to implement this kind of use case and many others quickly, efficiently and \u2013 above all \u2013 securely. Sigma protocols have not been deployed in such generic form within crypto before. Yet this kind of out-of-the-box functionality is hugely valuable, especially when no other DeFi platform offers it. Ergo enables new models of financial interaction, underpinned by smart contracts built on flexible and powerful Sigma protocols but easily accessible to developers. One of the most exciting things about blockchain is the possibility of making digital agreements without any trusted intermediaries. In the simplest use case, pioneered by Bitcoin, Alice can send a payment directly to Bob, wherever the two of them are located around the world, with no bank or any trusted third party needed. However, with the functionality of a modern blockchain like Ergo, it is possible to make far more complex and sophisticated financial agreements than simple payments. Take the following example. Gold-backed tokens Alice uses ERGs to purchase gold-backed tokens from Bob. Bob stores the gold in a secure vault, and uses the blockchain to issue one token for every Troy ounce of gold he has. Alice can then use these tokens freely in different contracts, transferring and trading them under whatever conditions she specifies in the smart contract code. When Alice wants to sell the tokens for physical gold, she can conduct another transaction with Bob, receiving ERG in return, at market price. The point of blockchain contracts is to eliminate the need for trust. While the purchase transaction is now trustless, in this instance Alice still needs to trust Bob about two things. Firstly, Bob may refuse to swap the gold tokens back to ERG at the correct price when Alice wants to sell. Secondly, Bob may default on his obligations \u2013 running away with the gold, or misusing the funds he receives and running a fractional reserve. Extending the contracts To address these issues, we can create an Oracle, or decentralised price feed. This uses multiple sources of external data to record the price of gold to the blockchain at regular intervals. This price feed will be the reference point for the redemption contract that manages the sale of Alice\u2019s gold with Bob (or any other participant). Thus the system automatically enforces the right price when a swap takes place. The second situation requires a third-party insurer, Charlie, whose service is also hosted on the blockchain with a smart contract. When Alice purchases gold from Bob, she additionally buys an insurance contract from Charlie. The payment can be dependent on factors including the amount of insurance required, and Bob\u2019s reputation \u2013 again, managed by a decentralized feedback mechanism. Now, if Bob defaults, Alice will automatically receive the value of her gold tokens, with Charlie effectively acting as a buyer of last resort. Programmable contracts There are, of course, many other example use cases like this one. We can also extend this use case, adding further economic actors. For example, Charlie may sell shares in his insurance business to Dave and other participants, providing them with a proportion of revenues in return for ensuring he has the capital he needs to cover any liabilities from the outset. However, even the most complex use case is simpler than general-purpose software that can be used to program any contract. After all, generalised logic must be both far-reaching and secure. Moreover, even a specialised contract is made up of many steps, each of which is fairly simple. Thus another requirement for a general-purpose platform is that it should simplify the process of writing contracts, making them as accessible (and safe) as possible. This can be achieved with the use of template agreements, with customisable parameters. The insurance contract above could be based on a module with flexible parameters, for example. This could be used and reused in many different circumstances.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"dev/scs/basics/#powerful-but-safe-contracts","text":"Ethereum is an exceptional platform, but there are things it does not do well.

Crowdfunding is a way of raising capital through the collective efforts of individuals. The campaigns are mostly started via the world wide web and allow projects and businesses to be funded by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people. One of the best known examples for successful crowdfunding startups is Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset. The company Oculus VR initiated its campaign in 2012 and was only two years later acquired by Facebook for $2 billion total. Besides the usual startups, there are also a lot of blockchain projects which went the way of crowdfunding, for example, Ethereum, Tron and EOS. Today, numerous platforms exist that allow you to publish your campaign. Some of the bigger ones are Indiegogo, Kickstarter, and Gofundme, only to name a few. Crowdfunding has a lot of benefits: a wide reach, efficiency, and marketing aspects being the most convincing... But for now, let's get onto what's really important! Introducing Crowdfunding on Ergo A few days ago, on August 28th, core developer Kushti stated on the (Ergo forum)[www.ergoforum.org] that he managed to successfully write and implement code that allows users to start a crowdfunding campaign on top of the Ergo blockchain (as mentioned in the whitepaper page 6 . This code even works with the current wallet API. Here is a quick guide on how to set up the wallet. In this article, you will learn how to do exactly that: crowdfunding on top of Ergo! It also takes you through the proposal of the first campaign ever, which is to fund the post-EIP1 crowdfunding script development. If you want to go into all the details, please read the following section, \u201cThe Script\u201d. Otherwise, you can simply skip to reading the \u201cHow To Donate\u201d, \"How To Collect Donations\", and \u201cCrowdfunding Project Proposal\u201d sections below that. The Script The simplest crowdfunding script, according to the ErgoScript White Paper (page 6) , is \u201ca script for the following crowdfunding situation: a project backer (with key backerPubKey) wishes to give money to a project (with key projectPubKey), but only if the project raises enough money (at least minToRaise) from other sources by a deadline (expressed in terms of HEIGHT). To give money to the project, the backer will create an output box protected by the following script. The script contains two conditions: one for the case the deadline has passed (enabling the backer to get the money back) and one for the case it succeeded (enabling the project to spend the money if the amount is at least minToRaise before the deadline). In order to ensure enough money has been raised, the script will search the output collection for a box with a sufficient value going to the projectPubKey. To check where the value of the output box is going, the script will read the script protecting the output box and compare it to the script corresponding to proveDlog(projectPubKey); this script can be obtained byprojectPubKey.propBytes. As currently the API does not support embedding of custom environment variables (only predefined ones like HEIGHT), the only way to compile the script is to replace such variables in the script from the white-paper with concrete values. For example, consider that a crowdfunding campaign is successful if it is raising 500 Ergs before block number 50,000. For backerPubKey and projectPubKey we can use PK() function which accepts only P2PK serialized keys at the moment. Then the modified script from the WhitePaper becomes the following: { val backerPubKey = PK(\"9h7DHKSDgE4uvP8313GVGdsEg3AvdAWSSTG7XZsLwBfeth4aePG\") val projectPubKey = PK(\"9gBSqNT9LH9WjvWbyqEvFirMbYp4nfGHnoWdceKGu45AKiya3Fq\") val deadline = 50000 val minToRaise = 500L * 1000000000 val fundraisingFailure = HEIGHT >= deadline && backerPubKey val enoughRaised = {(outBox: Box) =>outBox.value >= minToRaise && outBox.propositionBytes == projectPubKey.propBytes } val fundraisingSuccess = HEIGHT < deadline && projectPubKey && OUTPUTS.exists(enoughRaised) fundraisingFailure || fundraisingSuccess } How to Donate First of all, JSON is not supporting multi-line strings, so you need to replace line breaks with \\n . Also, quotes are to be escaped, so use \" instead of \". The resulting JSON will be sent to /script/p2sAddress . To donate to a project, first get your address from /wallet/addresses, take e.g. the first of them. Put the address into the backerPubKey, so a request to /script/p2sAddress will look like the following after this step: { \"source\": \"{ val backerPubKey = PK(\\\"9...\\\") val projectPubKey = PK(\\\"9gBSqNT9LH9WjvWbyqEvFirMbYp4nfGHnoWdceKGu45AKiya3Fq\\\") val deadline = 50000 val minToRaise = 500L * 1000000000 val fundraisingFailure = HEIGHT >= deadline && backerPubKey val enoughRaised = { (outBox: Box) => outBox.value >= minToRaise && outBox.propositionBytes == projectPubKey.propBytes } val fundraisingSuccess = HEIGHT < deadline && projectPubKey && OUTPUTS.exists(enoughRaised) fundraisingFailure || fundraisingSuccess }\" } with your address instead of \u201c9\u2026\u201d. Send the string to /script/p2sAddress to get a response like: { \"address\": \"GB3kh2izpWKvyZfMboQwsEscjPaZcz9WrzGqZB4ZrkzRreiFMV6HZYWXGMK3rqCjDCoPgWGNzfnYSUhivW4a1VRYPE7uZXwKnBcqWcRkiuTx6QW55EcPcWeELUsumwdtKoFtWY583nWnKZff\" } Copy address string (GB3\u2026 in our example) and send the money to it via /wallet/payment/send . A request to the API method to send 10 Ergs (10 Billion nanoErgs) will be like following: [ { \"address\": \"GB3kh2izpWKvyZfMboQwsEscjPaZcz9WrzGqZB4ZrkzRreiFMV6HZYWXGMK3rqCjDCoPgWGNzfnYSUhivW4a1VRYPE7uZXwKnBcqWcRkiuTx6QW55EcPcWeELUsumwdtKoFtWY583nWnKZff\", \"value\": 10000000000 } ] That\u2019s all! Now the wallet will automatically find the box on the blockchain, as it contains the public key which belongs to the wallet in the refund condition. The wallet then periodically checks whether the box is spendable by constructing a simplest transaction with the box as an input and just one output (to the same address). After refund height (50,000 in our example) the wallet will be able to spend the box and so the box value will be added to /wallet/balances. Please note that this will not be the case after EIP-1 3 implementation as the wallet will use narrow recognition patterns by then. How to Collect Donations The wallet which is associated with the project public key will find incoming boxes on the blockchain. However, it will fail to make sure that boxes are spendable, as the wallet currently is using a simplest transaction for that, and the script is failing for such a spending transaction. Before /wallet/boxes/uncertain method being implemented, the only way for a project to find incoming boxes. Then /wallet/transaction/send with manually provided (in \u201cinputsRaw\u201d) serialized boxes (use /utxo/byIdBinary to get the serialized box by its identifier). Kushti did that by himself and got the following transaction . Please note that EIP-1 will break this workflow as well. Kushti proposes to raise 500 Ergs before block 50,000 to develop command-line scripts (in Python) for organizing and participating in crowdfunding campaigns after EIP-1 implementation. Command-line scripts are more suitable than doing requests manually and also could be used for building graphic interfaces on top of them. The treasury did provide half of the funds , so others need to contribute the missing 250 Erg collectively. In case of a campaign failure refunds will be given automatically. As collecting pledges is not trivial at the moment, Kushti will lead the project role, so please use the following key, which is controlled by him: 9gBSqNT9LH9WjvWbyqEvFirMbYp4nfGHnoWdceKGu45AKiya3Fq In order to donate any amount of money, please follow the \u201cHow To Donate\u201d section above with replacing backerPubKey with your public key, and pledge amount with a proper value (please note that it is in nanoErgs, 1 Erg = 1.000.000.000 nanoErgs ).","title":"CrowdFunding"},{"location":"dev/scs/crowdfunding/#what-is-crowdfunding","text":"Crowdfunding is a way of raising capital through the collective efforts of individuals.

There is ErgoTree serialization section in https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf Constant-less lambdas part here https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/issues/264 Rational Massive script validation Consider a transaction tx which have INPUTS collection of boxes to spend. Every input box can have a script protecting it (propostionBytes property). This script should be executed in a context of the current transaction. The simplest transaction have 1 input box. Thus if we want to have a sustained block validation of 1000 transactions per second we need to be able to validate 1000 scripts per second at minimum. Additionally, the block validation time should be as small as possible so that a miner can start solving the PoW puzzle as soon as possible to increase the probability of the successful mining. For every script (of an input box) the following is done in order to validate it (and should be executed as fast as possible): A Context object is created with SELF = box ErgoTree is traversed to build a cost graph - the graph for the cost estimation Cost estimation is computed by evaluating the cost graph with the current context If the cost within the limit, the ErgoTree is evaluated using the context to obtain sigma proposition (see SigmaProp) Sigma protocol verification procedure is executed D.2.2 The Potential Script Processing Optimization Before an ErgoScript contract can be stored in a blockchain it should be first compiled from its source code into ErgoTree and then serialized into byte array. Because the ErgoTree is purely functional graph-based IR, the compiler may perform various optimizations for reducing a size of the tree. This will have an effect of normalization/unification, in which different original scripts may be compiled into the identical ErgoTrees and as a result the identical serialized bytes. In many cases two boxes will have the same ErgoTree up to a substitution of constants. For example all pay-to-public-key scripts have the same ErgoTree template in which only public key (constant of GroupElement type) is replaced. Because of normalization, and also because of script template reusability, the number different scripts templates is much less than the number of actual ErgoTrees in the UTXO boxes. For example we may have 1000s of different script templates in a blockchain with millions of UTXO boxes. The average reusability ratio is 1000 in this case. And even those 1000 different scripts may have different usage frequency. Having big reusability ratio we can optimize script evaluation by performing the step 2 from section D.2.1 only once per unique script. The compiled cost graph can be cached in Map[Array[Byte], Context => Int]. Every ErgoTree template extracted from an input box can be used as the key in this map to obtain the graph which is ready to execute. However, there is an obstacle to the optimization by caching, i.e. the constants embedded in contracts. In many cases it is natural to embed constants in the ErgoTree body with the most notable scenario is when public keys are embedded. As the result two functionally identical scripts are serialized to the different byte arrays because they have the different embedded constants. D.2.3 Templatized ErgoTree A solution to the problem with embedded constants is simple, we don\u2019t need to embed constants. Each constant in the body of ErgoTree can be replaced with an indexed placeholder node (see 63 ConstantPlaceholder). Each placeholder have an index of the constant in the constants collection of ErgoTree. The transformation is part of compilation and is performed ahead of time. Each ErgoTree have an array of all the constants extracted from its body. Each placeholder refers to the constant by the constant\u2019s index in the array. The index of the placeholder can be assigned by breadth-first topological order of the graph traversal during compilation of ErgoScript into ErgoTree. Whatever method is used, a placeholder should always refer to an existing constant. Thus the format of serialized ErgoTree with is shown in Figure 11 which contains: 1. The bytes of collection with segregated constants 2. The bytes of script expression with placeholders The collection of constants contains the serialized constant data (using ConstantSerializer) one after another. The script expression is a serialized Value with placeholders. Using such script format we can use the script expression bytes as a key in the cache. The observation is that after the constants are segregated, what remains is the template. Thus, instead of applying steps 1-2 from section D.2.1 to constant-full scripts we can apply them to constant-less templates. Before applying the steps 3 - 5 we need to bind placeholders with actual values taken from the constants collection and then evaluate both cost graph and ErgoTree.

Introduction ErgoScript is the smart contract language used by the Ergo blockchain. While it has concise syntax adopted from Scala/Kotlin, it still may seem confusing at first because conceptually ErgoScript is quite different compared to conventional languages which we all know and love. This is because Ergo is a UTXO based blockchain, whereas smart contracts are traditionally associated with account based systems like Ethereum. However, Ergo's transaction model has many advantages over the account based model and with the right approach it can even be significantly easier to develop Ergo contracts than to write and debug Solidity code. Below we will cover the key aspects of the Ergo contract model which makes it different: Paradigm The account model of Ethereum is imperative. This means that the typical task of sending coins from Alice to Bob requires changing the balances in storage as a series of operations. Ergo's UTXO based programming model on the other hand is declarative. ErgoScript contracts specify conditions for a transaction to be accepted by the blockchain (not changes to be made in the storage state as result of the contract execution). Scalability In the account model of Ethereum both storage changes and validity checks are performed on-chain during code execution. In contrast, Ergo transactions are created off-chain and only validation checks are performed on-chain thus reducing the amount of operations performed by every node on the network. In addition, due to immutability of the transaction graph, various optimization strategies are possible to improve throughput of transactions per second in the network. Light verifying nodes are also possible thus further facilitating scalability and accessibility of the network. Shared state The account-based model is reliant on shared mutable state which is known to lead to complex semantics (and subtle million dollar bugs) in the context of concurrent/ distributed computation. Ergo's model is based on an immutable graph of transactions. This approach, inherited from Bitcoin, plays well with the concurrent and distributed nature of blockchains and facilitates light trustless clients. Expressive Power Ethereum advocated execution of a turing-complete language on the blockchain. It theoretically promised unlimited potential, however in practice severe limitations came to light from excessive blockchain bloat, subtle multi-million dollar bugs, gas costs which limit contract complexity, and other such problems. Ergo on the flip side extends UTXO to enable turing-completeness while limiting the complexity of the ErgoScript language itself. The same expressive power is achieved in a different and more semantically sound way. With the all of the above points, it should be clear that there are a lot of benefits to the model Ergo is using. In the rest of this article I will introduce you to the concept of FlowCards - a dApp developer component which allows for designing complex Ergo contracts in a declarative and visual way. From Imperative to Declarative In the imperative programming model of Ethereum a transaction is a sequence of operations executed by the Ethereum VM. The following Solidity function implements a transfer of tokens from sender to receiver . The transaction starts when sender calls this function on an instance of a contract and ends when the function returns. // Sends an amount of existing coins from any caller to an address function send(address receiver, uint amount) public { require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], \"Insufficient balance.\"); balances[msg.sender] -= amount; balances[receiver] += amount; emit Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount); } The function first checks the pre-conditions, then updates the storage (i.e. balances) and finally publishes the post-condition as the Sent event. The gas which is consumed by the transaction is sent to the miner as a reward for executing this transaction. Unlike Ethereum, a transaction in Ergo is a data structure holding a list of input coins which it spends and a list of output coins which it creates preserving the total balances of ERGs and tokens (in which Ergo is similar to Bitcoin). Turning back to the example above, since Ergo natively supports tokens, therefore for this specific example of sending tokens we don't need to write any code in ErgoScript. Instead we need to create the 'send' transaction shown in the following figure, which describes the same token transfer but declaratively. The picture visually describes the following steps, which the network user needs to perform: 1) Select unspent sender's boxes, containing in total tB >= amount of tokens and B >= txFee + minErg ERGs. 2) Create an output target box which is protected by the receiver public key with minErg ERGs and amount of T tokens. 3) Create one fee output protected by the minerFee contract with txFee ERGs. 4) Create one change output protected by the sender public key, containing B - minErg - txFee ERGs and tB - amount of T tokens. 5) Create a new transaction, sign it using the sender's secret key and send to the Ergo network. What is important to understand here is that all of these steps are preformed off-chain (for example using Appkit Transaction API) by the user's application. Ergo network nodes don't need to repeat this transaction creation process, they only need to validate the already formed transaction. ErgoScript contracts are stored in the inputs of the transaction and check spending conditions. The node executes the contracts on-chain when the transaction is validated. The transaction is valid if all of the conditions are satisfied. Thus, in Ethereum when we \"send amount from sender to recipient\" we are literally editing balances and updating the storage with a concrete set of commands. This happens on-chain and thus a new transaction is also created on-chain as the result of this process. In Ergo (as in Bitcoin) transactions are created off-chain and the network nodes only verify them. The effects of the transaction on the blockchain state is that input coins (or Boxes in Ergo's parlance) are removed and output boxes are added to the UTXO set. In the example above we don't use an ErgoScript contract but instead assume a signature check is used as the spending pre-condition. However in more complex application scenarios we of course need to use ErgoScript which is what we are going to discuss next. From Changing State to Checking Context In the send function example we first checked the pre-condition ( require(amount <= balances[msg.sender],...) ) and then changed the state (i.e. update balances balances[msg.sender] -= amount ). This is typical in Ethereum transactions. Before we change anything we need to check if it is valid to do so. In Ergo, as we discussed previously, the state (i.e. UTXO set of boxes) is changed implicitly when a valid transaction is included in a block. Thus we only need to check the pre-conditions before the transaction can be added to the block. This is what ErgoScript contracts do. It is not possible to \"change the state\" in ErgoScript because it is a language to check pre-conditions for spending coins. ErgoScript is a purely functional language without side effects that operates on immutable data values. This means all the inputs, outputs and other transaction parameters available in a script are immutable. This, among other things, makes ErgoScript a very simple language that is easy to learn and safe to use. Similar to Bitcoin, each input box contains a script, which should return the true value in order to 1) allow spending of the box (i.e. removing from the UTXO set) and 2) adding the transaction to the block. If we are being pedantic, it is therefore incorrect (strictly speaking) to think of ErgoScript as the language of Ergo contracts, because it is the language of propositions (logical predicates, formulas, etc.) which protect boxes from \"illegal\" spending. Unlike Bitcoin, in Ergo the whole transaction and a part of the current blockchain context is available to every script. Therefore each script may check which outputs are created by the transaction, their ERG and token amounts (we will use this capability in our example DEX contracts), current block number etc. In ErgoScript you define the conditions of whether changes (i.e. coin spending) are allowed to happen in a given context. This is in contrast to programming the changes imperatively in the code of a contract. While Ergo's transaction model unlocks a whole range of applications like (DEX, DeFi Apps, LETS, etc), designing contracts as pre-conditions for coin spending (or guarding scripts) directly is not intuitive. In the next sections we will consider a useful graphical notation to design contracts declaratively using FlowCard Diagrams , which is a visual representation of executable components (FlowCards). FlowCards aim to radically simplify dApp development on the Ergo platform by providing a high-level declarative language, execution runtime, storage format and a graphical notation . We will start with a high level of diagrams and go down to FlowCard specification. FlowCard Diagrams The idea behind FlowCard diagrams is based on the following observations: 1) An Ergo box is immutable and can only be spent in the transaction which uses it as an input. 2) We therefore can draw a flow of boxes through transactions, so that boxes flowing in to the transaction are spent and those flowing out are created and added to the UTXO. 3) A transaction from this perspective is simply a transformer of old boxes to the new ones preserving the balances of ERGs and tokens involved. The following figure shows the main elements of the Ergo transaction we've already seen previously (now under the name of FlowCard Diagram). There is a strictly defined meaning (semantics) behind every element of the diagram , so that the diagram is a visual representation (or a view) of the underlying executable component (called FlowCard). The FlowCard can be used as a reusable component of an Ergo dApp to create and initiate the transaction on the Ergo blockchain. We will discuss this in the coming sections. Now let's look at the individual pieces of the FlowCard diagram one by one. 1. Name and Parameters Each flow card is given a name and a list of typed parameters. This is similar to a template with parameters. In the above figure we can see the Send flow card which has five parameters. The parameters are used in the specification. 2. Contract Wallet This is a key element of the flow card. Every box has a guarding script. Often it is the script that checks a signature against a public key. This script is trivial in ErgoScript and is defined like the def pk(pubkey: Address) = { pubkey } template where pubkey is a parameter of the type Address . In the figure, the script template is applied to the parameter pk(sender) and thus a concrete wallet contract is obtained. Therefore pk(sender) and pk(receiver) yield different scripts and represent different wallets on the diagram, even though they use the same template. Contract Wallet contains a set of all UTXO boxes which have a given script derived from the given script template using flow card parameters. For example, in the figure, the template is pk and parameter pubkey is substituted with the `sender' flow card parameter. 3. Contract Even though a contract is a property of a box, on the diagram we group the boxes by their contracts, therefore it looks like the boxes belong to the contracts, rather than the contracts belong to the boxes. In the example, we have three instantiated contracts pk(sender) , pk(receiver) and minerFee . Note, that pk(sender) is the instantiation of the pk template with the concrete parameter sender and minerFee is the instantiation of the pre-defined contract which protects the miner reward boxes. 4. Box name In the diagram we can give each box a name. Besides readability of the diagram, we also use the name as a synonym of a more complex indexed access to the box in the contract. For example, change is the name of the box, which can also be used in the ErgoScript conditions instead of OUTPUTS(2) . We also use box names to associate spending conditions with the boxes. 5. Boxes in the wallet In the diagram, we show boxes (darker rectangles) as belonging to the contract wallets (lighter rectangles). Each such box rectangle is connected with a grey transaction rectangle by either orange or green arrows or both. An output box (with an incoming green arrow) may include many lines of text where each line specifies a condition which should be checked as part of the transaction. The first line specifies the condition on the amount of ERG which should be placed in the box. Other lines may take one of the following forms: 1) amount: TOKEN - the box should contain the given amount of the given TOKEN 2) R == value - the box should contain the given value of the given register R 3) boxName ? condition - the box named boxName should check condition in its script. We discuss these conditions in the sections below. 6. Amount of ERGs in the box Each box should store a minimum amount of ERGs. This is checked when the creating transaction is validated. In the diagram the amount of ERGs is always shown as the first line (e.g. B: ERG or B - minErg - txFee ). The value type ascription B: ERG is optional and may be used for readability. When the value is given as a formula, then this formula should be respected by the transaction which creates the box. It is important to understand that variables like amount and txFee are not named properties of the boxes. They are parameters of the whole diagram and representing some amounts. Or put it another way, they are shared parameters between transactions (e.g. Sell Order and Swap transactions from DEX example below share the tAmt parameter). So the same name is tied to the same value throughout the diagram (this is where the tooling would help a lot). However, when it comes to on-chain validation of those values, only explicit conditions which are marked with ? are transformed to ErgoScript. At the same time, all other conditions are ensured off-chain during transaction building (for example in an application using Appkit API) and transaction validation when it is added to the blockchain. 7. Amount of T token A box can store values of many tokens. The tokens on the diagram are named and a value variable may be associated with the token T using value: T expression. The value may be given by formula. If the formula is prefixed with a box name like boxName ? formula , then it is should also be checked in the guarding script of the boxName box. This additional specification is very convenient because 1) it allows to validate the visual design automatically, and 2) the conditions specified in the boxes of a diagram are enough to synthesize the necessary guarding scripts. (more about this below at \"From Diagrams To ErgoScript Contracts\" ) 8. Tx Inputs Inputs are connected to the corresponding transaction by orange arrows. An input arrow may have a label of the following forms: 1) name@index - optional name with an index i.e. fee@0 or @2 . This is a property of the target endpoint of the arrow. The name is used in conditions of related boxes and the index is the position of the corresponding box in the INPUTS collection of the transaction. 2) !action - is a property of the source of the arrow and gives a name for an alternative spending path of the box (we will see this in DEX example) Because of alternative spending paths, a box may have many outgoing orange arrows, in which case they should be labeled with different actions. 9. Transaction A transaction spends input boxes and creates output boxes. The input boxes are given by the orange arrows and the labels are expected to put inputs at the right indexes in INPUTS collection. The output boxes are given by the green arrows. Each transaction should preserve a strict balance of ERG values (sum of inputs == sum of outputs) and for each token the sum of inputs >= the sum of outputs. The design diagram requires an explicit specification of the ERG and token values for all of the output boxes to avoid implicit errors and ensure better readability. 10. Tx Outputs Outputs are connected to the corresponding transaction by green arrows. An output arrow may have a label of the following form name@index , where an optional name is accompanied with an index i.e. fee@0 or @2 . This is a property of the source endpoint of the arrow. The name is used in conditions of the related boxes and the index is the position of the corresponding box in the OUTPUTS collection of the transaction. Example: Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Now let's use the above described notation to design a FlowCard for a DEX dApp. It is simple enough yet also illustrates all of the key features of FlowCard diagrams which we've introduced in the previous section. The dApp scenario is shown in the figure below: There are three participants (buyer, seller and DEX) of the DEX dApp and five different transaction types, which are created by participants. The buyer wants to swap ergAmt of ERGs for tAmt of TID tokens (or vice versa, the seller wants to sell TID tokens for ERGs, who sends the order first doesn't matter). Both the buyer and the seller can cancel their orders any time. The DEX off-chain matching service can find matching orders and create the Swap transaction to complete the exchange. The following diagram fully (and formally) specifies all of the five transactions that must be created off-chain by the DEX dApp. It also specifies all of the spending conditions that should be verified on-chain . Let's discuss the FlowCard diagram and the logic of each transaction in details: Buy Order Transaction A buyer creates a Buy Order transaction. The transaction spends E amount of ERGs (which we will write E: ERG ) from one or more boxes in the pk(buyer) wallet. The transaction creates a bid box with ergAmt: ERG protected by the buyOrder script. The buyOrder script is synthesized from the specification (see below at \"From Diagrams To ErgoScript Contracts\" ) either manually or automatically by a tool. Even though we don't need to define the buyOrder script explicitly during designing, at run time the bid box should contain the buyOrder script as the guarding proposition (which checks the box spending conditions), otherwise the conditions specified in the diagram will not be checked. The change box is created to make the input and output sums of the transaction balanced. The transaction fee box is omitted because it can be added automatically by the tools. In practice, however, the designer can add the fee box explicitly to the a diagram. It covers the cases of more complex transactions (like Swap) where there are many ways to pay the transaction fee. Cancel Buy, Cancel Sell Transactions At any time, the buyer can cancel the order by sending CancelBuy transaction. The transaction should satisfy the guarding buyOrder contract which protects the bid box. As you can see on the diagram, both the Cancel and the Swap transactions can spend the bid box. When a box has spending alternatives (or spending paths ) then each alternative is identified by a unique name prefixed with ! ( !cancel and !swap for the bid box). Each alternative path has specific spending conditions. In our example, when the Cancel Buy transaction spends the bid box the ?buyer condition should be satisfied, which we read as \"the signature for the buyer address should be presented in the transaction\". Therefore, only buyer can cancel the buy order. This \"signature\" condition is only required for the !cancel alternative spending path and not required for !swap . Sell Order Transaction The Sell Order transaction is similar to the BuyOrder in that it deals with tokens in addition to ERGs. The transaction spends E: ERG and T: TID tokens from seller's wallet (specified as pk(seller) contract). The two outputs are ask and change . The change is a standard box to balance transaction. The ask box keeps tAmt: TID tokens for the exchange and minErg: ERG - the minimum amount of ERGs required in every box. Swap Transaction This is a key transaction in the DEX dApp scenario. The transaction has several spending conditions on the input boxes and those conditions are included in the buyOrder and sellOrder scripts (which are verified when the transaction is added to the blockchain). However, on the diagram those conditions are not specified in the bid and ask boxes, they are instead defined in the output boxes of the transaction. This is a convention for improved usability because most of the conditions relate to the properties of the output boxes. We could specify those properties in the bid box, but then we would have to use more complex expressions. Let's consider the output created by the arrow labeled with buyerOut@0 . This label tells us that the output is at the index 0 in the OUTPUTS collection of the transaction and that in the diagram we can refer to this box by the buyerOut name. Thus we can label both the box itself and the arrow to give the box a name. The conditions shown in the buyerOut box have the form bid ? condition , which means they should be verified on-chain in order to spend the bid box. The conditions have the following meaning: - tAmt: TID requires the box to have tAmt amount of TID token - R4 == bid.id requires R4 register in the box to be equal to id of the bid box. - script == buyer requires the buyerOut box to have the script of the wallet where it is located on the diagram, i.e. pk(buyer) Similar properties are added to the sellerOut box, which is specified to be at index 1 and the name is given to it using the label on the box itself, rather than on the arrow. The Swap transaction spends two boxes bid and ask using the !swap spending path on both, however unlike !cancel the conditions on the path are not specified. This is where the bid ? and ask ? prefixes come into play. They are used so that the conditions listed in the buyerOut and sellerOut boxes are moved to the !swap spending path of the bid and ask boxes correspondingly. If you look at the conditions of the output boxes, you will see that they exactly specify the swap of values between seller's and buyer's wallets. The buyer gets the necessary amount of TID token and seller gets the corresponding amount of ERGs. The Swap transaction is created when there are two matching boxes with buyOrder and sellOrder contracts. From Diagrams To ErgoScript Contracts What is interesting about FlowCard specifications is that we can use them to automatically generate the necessary ErgoTree scripts. With the appropriate tooling support this can be done automatically, but with the lack of thereof, it can be done manually. Thus, the FlowCard allows us to capture and visually represent all of the design choices and semantic details of an Ergo dApp. What we are going to do next is to mechanically create the buyOrder contract from the information given in the DEX flow card. Recall that each script is a proposition (boolean valued expression) which should evaluate to true to allow spending of the box. When we have many conditions to be met at the same time we can combine them in a logical formula using the AND binary operation, and if we have alternatives (not necessarily exclusive) we can put them into the OR operation. The buyOrder box has the alternative spending paths !cancel and !swap . Thus the ErgoScript code should have OR operation with two arguments - one for each spending path. /** buyOrder contract */ { val cancelCondition = {} val swapCondition = {} cancelCondition || swapCondition } The formula for the cancelCondition expression is given in the !cancel spending path of the buyOrder box. We can directly include it in the script. /** buyOrder contract */ { val cancelCondition = { buyer } val swapCondition = {} cancelCondition || swapCondition } For the !swap spending path of the buyOrder box the conditions are specified in the buyerOut output box of the Swap transaction. If we simply include them in the swapCondition then we get a syntactically incorrect script. /** buyOrder contract */ { val cancelCondition = { buyer } val swapCondition = { tAmt: TID && R4 == bid.id && @contract } cancelCondition || swapCondition } We can however translate the conditions from the diagram syntax to ErgoScript expressions using the following simple rules 1) buyerOut@0 ==> val buyerOut = OUTPUTS(0) 2) tAmt: TID ==> tid._2 == tAmt where tid = buyerOut.tokens(TID) 3) R4 == bid.id ==> R4 == SELF.id where R4 = buyerOut.R4[Coll[Byte]].get 4) script == buyer ==> buyerOut.propositionBytes == buyer.propBytes Note, in the diagram TID represents a token id, but ErgoScript doesn't have access to the tokens by the ids so we cannot write tokens.getByKey(TID) . For this reason, when the diagram is translated into ErgoScript, TID becomes a named constant of the index in tokens collection of the box. The concrete value of the constant is assigned when the BuyOrder transaction with the buyOrder box is created. The correspondence and consistency between the actual tokenId, the TID constant and the actual tokens of the buyerOut box is ensured by the off-chain application code, which is completely possible since all of the transactions are created by the application using FlowCard as a guiding specification. This may sound too complicated, but this is part of the translation from diagram specification to actual executable application code, most of which can be automated. After the transformation we can obtain a correct script which checks all the required preconditions for spending the buyOrder box. /** buyOrder contract */ def DEX(buyer: Addrss, seller: Address, TID: Int, ergAmt: Long, tAmt: Long) { val cancelCondition: SigmaProp = { buyer } // verify buyer's sig (ProveDlog) val swapCondition = OUTPUTS.size > 0 && { // securing OUTPUTS access val buyerOut = OUTPUTS(0) // from buyerOut@0 buyerOut.tokens.size > TID && { // securing tokens access val tid = buyerOut.tokens(TID) val regR4 = buyerOut.R4[Coll[Byte]] regR4.isDefined && { // securing R4 access val R4 = regR4.get tid._2 == tAmt && // from tAmt: TID R4 == SELF.id && // from R4 == bid.id buyerOut.propositionBytes == buyer.propBytes // from script == buyer } } } cancelCondition || swapCondition } A similar script for the sellOrder box can be obtained using the same translation rules. With the help of the tooling the code of contracts can be mechanically generated from the diagram specification. Conclusions Declarative programming models have already won the battle against imperative programming in many application domains like Big Data, Stream Processing, Deep Learning, Databases, etc. Ergo is pioneering the declarative model of dApp development as a better and safer alternative to the now popular imperative model of smart contracts. The concept of FlowCard shifts the focus from writing ErgoScript contracts to the overall flow of values (hence the name), in such a way, that ErgoScript can always be generated from them. You will never need to look at the ErgoScript code once the tooling is in place. Here are the possible next steps for future work: 1) Storage format for FlowCard Spec and the corresponding EIP standardized file format (Json/XML/Protobuf). This will allow various tools (Diagram Editor, Runtime, dApps etc) to create and use *.flowcard files. 2) FlowCard Viewer, which can generate the diagrams from *.flowcard files. 3) FlowCard Runtime, which can run *.flowcard files, create and send transactions to Ergo network. 4) FlowCard Designer Tool, which can simplify development of complex diagrams . This will make designing and validation of Ergo contracts a pleasant experience, more like drawing rather than coding. In addition, the correctness of the whole dApp scenario can be verified and controlled by the tooling.

Turning back to the example above, since Ergo natively supports tokens, therefore for this specific example of sending tokens we don't need to write any code in ErgoScript. Instead we need to create the 'send' transaction shown in the following figure, which describes the same token transfer but declaratively. The picture visually describes the following steps, which the network user needs to perform: 1) Select unspent sender's boxes, containing in total tB >= amount of tokens and B >= txFee + minErg ERGs. 2) Create an output target box which is protected by the receiver public key with minErg ERGs and amount of T tokens. 3) Create one fee output protected by the minerFee contract with txFee ERGs. 4) Create one change output protected by the sender public key, containing B - minErg - txFee ERGs and tB - amount of T tokens. 5) Create a new transaction, sign it using the sender's secret key and send to the Ergo network. What is important to understand here is that all of these steps are preformed off-chain (for example using Appkit Transaction API) by the user's application. Ergo network nodes don't need to repeat this transaction creation process, they only need to validate the already formed transaction. ErgoScript contracts are stored in the inputs of the transaction and check spending conditions. The node executes the contracts on-chain when the transaction is validated. The transaction is valid if all of the conditions are satisfied. Thus, in Ethereum when we \"send amount from sender to recipient\" we are literally editing balances and updating the storage with a concrete set of commands. This happens on-chain and thus a new transaction is also created on-chain as the result of this process. In Ergo (as in Bitcoin) transactions are created off-chain and the network nodes only verify them. The effects of the transaction on the blockchain state is that input coins (or Boxes in Ergo's parlance) are removed and output boxes are added to the UTXO set. In the example above we don't use an ErgoScript contract but instead assume a signature check is used as the spending pre-condition. However in more complex application scenarios we of course need to use ErgoScript which is what we are going to discuss next.","title":"From Imperative to Declarative"},{"location":"dev/scs/flowcards/#from-changing-state-to-checking-context","text":"In the send function example we first checked the pre-condition ( require(amount <= balances[msg.sender],...) ) and then changed the state (i.e. update balances balances[msg.sender] -= amount ). This is typical in Ethereum transactions. Before we change anything we need to check if it is valid to do so. In Ergo, as we discussed previously, the state (i.e. UTXO set of boxes) is changed implicitly when a valid transaction is included in a block. Thus we only need to check the pre-conditions before the transaction can be added to the block. This is what ErgoScript contracts do. It is not possible to \"change the state\" in ErgoScript because it is a language to check pre-conditions for spending coins. ErgoScript is a purely functional language without side effects that operates on immutable data values. This means all the inputs, outputs and other transaction parameters available in a script are immutable. This, among other things, makes ErgoScript a very simple language that is easy to learn and safe to use. Similar to Bitcoin, each input box contains a script, which should return the true value in order to 1) allow spending of the box (i.e. removing from the UTXO set) and 2) adding the transaction to the block. If we are being pedantic, it is therefore incorrect (strictly speaking) to think of ErgoScript as the language of Ergo contracts, because it is the language of propositions (logical predicates, formulas, etc.) which protect boxes from \"illegal\" spending. Unlike Bitcoin, in Ergo the whole transaction and a part of the current blockchain context is available to every script. Therefore each script may check which outputs are created by the transaction, their ERG and token amounts (we will use this capability in our example DEX contracts), current block number etc. In ErgoScript you define the conditions of whether changes (i.e. coin spending) are allowed to happen in a given context. This is in contrast to programming the changes imperatively in the code of a contract. While Ergo's transaction model unlocks a whole range of applications like (DEX, DeFi Apps, LETS, etc), designing contracts as pre-conditions for coin spending (or guarding scripts) directly is not intuitive. In the next sections we will consider a useful graphical notation to design contracts declaratively using FlowCard Diagrams , which is a visual representation of executable components (FlowCards). FlowCards aim to radically simplify dApp development on the Ergo platform by providing a high-level declarative language, execution runtime, storage format and a graphical notation . We will start with a high level of diagrams and go down to FlowCard specification.","title":"From Changing State to Checking Context"},{"location":"dev/scs/flowcards/#flowcard-diagrams","text":"The idea behind FlowCard diagrams is based on the following observations: 1) An Ergo box is immutable and can only be spent in the transaction which uses it as an input. 2) We therefore can draw a flow of boxes through transactions, so that boxes flowing in to the transaction are spent and those flowing out are created and added to the UTXO. 3) A transaction from this perspective is simply a transformer of old boxes to the new ones preserving the balances of ERGs and tokens involved. The following figure shows the main elements of the Ergo transaction we've already seen previously (now under the name of FlowCard Diagram). There is a strictly defined meaning (semantics) behind every element of the diagram , so that the diagram is a visual representation (or a view) of the underlying executable component (called FlowCard). The FlowCard can be used as a reusable component of an Ergo dApp to create and initiate the transaction on the Ergo blockchain. We will discuss this in the coming sections.

In the figure, the script template is applied to the parameter pk(sender) and thus a concrete wallet contract is obtained. Therefore pk(sender) and pk(receiver) yield different scripts and represent different wallets on the diagram, even though they use the same template. Contract Wallet contains a set of all UTXO boxes which have a given script derived from the given script template using flow card parameters. For example, in the figure, the template is pk and parameter pubkey is substituted with the `sender' flow card parameter.","title":"2.

When the value is given as a formula, then this formula should be respected by the transaction which creates the box. It is important to understand that variables like amount and txFee are not named properties of the boxes. They are parameters of the whole diagram and representing some amounts. Or put it another way, they are shared parameters between transactions (e.g. Sell Order and Swap transactions from DEX example below share the tAmt parameter). So the same name is tied to the same value throughout the diagram (this is where the tooling would help a lot). However, when it comes to on-chain validation of those values, only explicit conditions which are marked with ? are transformed to ErgoScript.

The dApp scenario is shown in the figure below: There are three participants (buyer, seller and DEX) of the DEX dApp and five different transaction types, which are created by participants. The buyer wants to swap ergAmt of ERGs for tAmt of TID tokens (or vice versa, the seller wants to sell TID tokens for ERGs, who sends the order first doesn't matter). Both the buyer and the seller can cancel their orders any time. The DEX off-chain matching service can find matching orders and create the Swap transaction to complete the exchange. The following diagram fully (and formally) specifies all of the five transactions that must be created off-chain by the DEX dApp. It also specifies all of the spending conditions that should be verified on-chain .

The buyOrder script is synthesized from the specification (see below at \"From Diagrams To ErgoScript Contracts\" ) either manually or automatically by a tool. Even though we don't need to define the buyOrder script explicitly during designing, at run time the bid box should contain the buyOrder script as the guarding proposition (which checks the box spending conditions), otherwise the conditions specified in the diagram will not be checked. The change box is created to make the input and output sums of the transaction balanced. The transaction fee box is omitted because it can be added automatically by the tools. In practice, however, the designer can add the fee box explicitly to the a diagram.

When a box has spending alternatives (or spending paths ) then each alternative is identified by a unique name prefixed with ! ( !cancel and !swap for the bid box). Each alternative path has specific spending conditions. In our example, when the Cancel Buy transaction spends the bid box the ?buyer condition should be satisfied, which we read as \"the signature for the buyer address should be presented in the transaction\". Therefore, only buyer can cancel the buy order. This \"signature\" condition is only required for the !cancel alternative spending path and not required for !swap .","title":"Cancel Buy, Cancel Sell Transactions"},{"location":"dev/scs/flowcards/#sell-order-transaction","text":"The Sell Order transaction is similar to the BuyOrder in that it deals with tokens in addition to ERGs. The transaction spends E: ERG and T: TID tokens from seller's wallet (specified as pk(seller) contract). The two outputs are ask and change . The change is a standard box to balance transaction. The ask box keeps tAmt: TID tokens for the exchange and minErg: ERG - the minimum amount of ERGs required in every box.","title":"Sell Order Transaction"},{"location":"dev/scs/flowcards/#swap-transaction","text":"This is a key transaction in the DEX dApp scenario. The transaction has several spending conditions on the input boxes and those conditions are included in the buyOrder and sellOrder scripts (which are verified when the transaction is added to the blockchain). However, on the diagram those conditions are not specified in the bid and ask boxes, they are instead defined in the output boxes of the transaction. This is a convention for improved usability because most of the conditions relate to the properties of the output boxes. We could specify those properties in the bid box, but then we would have to use more complex expressions. Let's consider the output created by the arrow labeled with buyerOut@0 . This label tells us that the output is at the index 0 in the OUTPUTS collection of the transaction and that in the diagram we can refer to this box by the buyerOut name. Thus we can label both the box itself and the arrow to give the box a name. The conditions shown in the buyerOut box have the form bid ? condition , which means they should be verified on-chain in order to spend the bid box. The conditions have the following meaning: - tAmt: TID requires the box to have tAmt amount of TID token - R4 == bid.id requires R4 register in the box to be equal to id of the bid box. - script == buyer requires the buyerOut box to have the script of the wallet where it is located on the diagram, i.e. pk(buyer) Similar properties are added to the sellerOut box, which is specified to be at index 1 and the name is given to it using the label on the box itself, rather than on the arrow. The Swap transaction spends two boxes bid and ask using the !swap spending path on both, however unlike !cancel the conditions on the path are not specified. This is where the bid ? and ask ? prefixes come into play. They are used so that the conditions listed in the buyerOut and sellerOut boxes are moved to the !swap spending path of the bid and ask boxes correspondingly. If you look at the conditions of the output boxes, you will see that they exactly specify the swap of values between seller's and buyer's wallets. The buyer gets the necessary amount of TID token and seller gets the corresponding amount of ERGs. The Swap transaction is created when there are two matching boxes with buyOrder and sellOrder contracts.","title":"Swap Transaction"},{"location":"dev/scs/flowcards/#from-diagrams-to-ergoscript-contracts","text":"What is interesting about FlowCard specifications is that we can use them to automatically generate the necessary ErgoTree scripts. With the appropriate tooling support this can be done automatically, but with the lack of thereof, it can be done manually. Thus, the FlowCard allows us to capture and visually represent all of the design choices and semantic details of an Ergo dApp. What we are going to do next is to mechanically create the buyOrder contract from the information given in the DEX flow card. Recall that each script is a proposition (boolean valued expression) which should evaluate to true to allow spending of the box. When we have many conditions to be met at the same time we can combine them in a logical formula using the AND binary operation, and if we have alternatives (not necessarily exclusive) we can put them into the OR operation. The buyOrder box has the alternative spending paths !cancel and !swap . Thus the ErgoScript code should have OR operation with two arguments - one for each spending path. /** buyOrder contract */ { val cancelCondition = {} val swapCondition = {} cancelCondition || swapCondition } The formula for the cancelCondition expression is given in the !cancel spending path of the buyOrder box. We can directly include it in the script. /** buyOrder contract */ { val cancelCondition = { buyer } val swapCondition = {} cancelCondition || swapCondition } For the !swap spending path of the buyOrder box the conditions are specified in the buyerOut output box of the Swap transaction. If we simply include them in the swapCondition then we get a syntactically incorrect script. /** buyOrder contract */ { val cancelCondition = { buyer } val swapCondition = { tAmt: TID && R4 == bid.id && @contract } cancelCondition || swapCondition } We can however translate the conditions from the diagram syntax to ErgoScript expressions using the following simple rules 1) buyerOut@0 ==> val buyerOut = OUTPUTS(0) 2) tAmt: TID ==> tid._2 == tAmt where tid = buyerOut.tokens(TID) 3) R4 == bid.id ==> R4 == SELF.id where R4 = buyerOut.R4[Coll[Byte]].get 4) script == buyer ==> buyerOut.propositionBytes == buyer.propBytes Note, in the diagram TID represents a token id, but ErgoScript doesn't have access to the tokens by the ids so we cannot write tokens.getByKey(TID) . For this reason, when the diagram is translated into ErgoScript, TID becomes a named constant of the index in tokens collection of the box. The concrete value of the constant is assigned when the BuyOrder transaction with the buyOrder box is created. The correspondence and consistency between the actual tokenId, the TID constant and the actual tokens of the buyerOut box is ensured by the off-chain application code, which is completely possible since all of the transactions are created by the application using FlowCard as a guiding specification. This may sound too complicated, but this is part of the translation from diagram specification to actual executable application code, most of which can be automated. After the transformation we can obtain a correct script which checks all the required preconditions for spending the buyOrder box. /** buyOrder contract */ def DEX(buyer: Addrss, seller: Address, TID: Int, ergAmt: Long, tAmt: Long) { val cancelCondition: SigmaProp = { buyer } // verify buyer's sig (ProveDlog) val swapCondition = OUTPUTS.size > 0 && { // securing OUTPUTS access val buyerOut = OUTPUTS(0) // from buyerOut@0 buyerOut.tokens.size > TID && { // securing tokens access val tid = buyerOut.tokens(TID) val regR4 = buyerOut.R4[Coll[Byte]] regR4.isDefined && { // securing R4 access val R4 = regR4.get tid._2 == tAmt && // from tAmt: TID R4 == SELF.id && // from R4 == bid.id buyerOut.propositionBytes == buyer.propBytes // from script == buyer } } } cancelCondition || swapCondition } A similar script for the sellOrder box can be obtained using the same translation rules.

You will never need to look at the ErgoScript code once the tooling is in place.

This will allow various tools (Diagram Editor, Runtime, dApps etc) to create and use *.flowcard files. 2) FlowCard Viewer, which can generate the diagrams from *.flowcard files. 3) FlowCard Runtime, which can run *.flowcard files, create and send transactions to Ergo network. 4) FlowCard Designer Tool, which can simplify development of complex diagrams .

Basically it means that just another buzzword is considered by big banksters as just another tool to extract value from everywhere in a more efficient way, and also to save on cutting job positions. While I am avoiding to say anything about \"Satoshi's vision\" (nothing but speculations could be dug there after his exodus), a broad view I witnessed in the early years around online forums users is that a cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich the ordinary people behind their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital. The tools of a cryptocurrency in the eyes of the original broad community vision should allow people to do economic activity dependless on business size, geographic location, interest rates set by big players, and so on. The tools should allow people to do contracts (no paper contracts, but digital, self-enforcing, and reasonably smart contracts) dependless on differences in jurisdictions, traditions, followed business practices etc. I hope Ergo would be useful here. Thousands of small cooperatives and individual entrepreneurs are more important to healthy and sustainable wealth growth around the globe than a couple of corporations hiding profits in offshore heavens. As an example, let's consider a cooperative federation (such as Radical Routes ) willing to provide financial help to an entrepreneur thousands kilometers away (say, in Rojava). We need to assume some details now. In the first place, assume that there are four cooperatives in the network. They collectively lock 10,000 Ergs (in equal parts, so 2,500 Ergs each) in a contract, which says the following: The cooperatives are associated with public keys pubkeyA , pubkeyB , pubkeyC , pubkeyD . The entrepreneur is associated with a public key businessKey . The cooperatives are locking money in a coin protected by a funding contract, then doing due diligence and vote on whether to fund the entrepreneur or not. All the contract fund ( 10,000 Ergs) is going to the entrepreneur if 3 votes out of 4 are for that. Technically, the voting is done via 3-out-of-4 threshold signature. If voting is not successful ( 3 out of 4 signatures are not collected) before the block number 1,000 , any cooperative (actually, anyone) can submit withdraw transaction, which is returning 2,500 Ergs (at least) to every cooperative. Further, the funding contract will also be called the voting contract. The investments could be spent on three goals, with some strict bounds. Namely, the entrepreneur must spend at least 5,000 Ergs on equipment, at least 2,000 Ergs on construction of a building needed, other funds the entrepreneur may spend arbitrarily. To be sure that equipment money will be spent on equipment, the cooperative federation is using public keys of known equipment sellers in the area of the entrepreneur. For example, consider that there are equipment sellers with public keys pubkeyTool1 , pubkeyTool2 , pubkeyTool3 , pubkeyTool4 in the area. Technically, the transfer is organized as a collective signature of one equipment sellers (thus ring signature from equipment sellers ring AND entrepreneur's signature) Similarly, assume that there are 3 builders in the are cooperative federation is recognizing, associated with public keys pubkeyConstr1 , pubkeyConstr2 , and pubkeyConstr3 . Similarly to the voting contract, if equipment and construction contracts are not co-signed before block number 5000 , the federation cooperatives could withdraw funds. There are different ways to define contracts in Ergo. A script in the low-level language, ErgoTree , is describing a (single) logical condition on whether a coin could be spent according it, and also a spending proof provided by a spending transaction. Internally, the condition is represented as a typed syntax tree thus the name. The structure is allowing us to do ahead-of-time cost analysis etc. Higher-level language called ErgoScript allows to have more traditional and readable description, use variables and break logic into subroutines. Let's start with the main contract defined in (1-3) above: { val votingSuccess = atLeast(3, Array(pubkeyA, pubkeyB, pubkeyC, pubkeyD)) val properSpending = OUTPUTS(0).value >= 5000L && blake2b256(OUTPUTS(0).propositionBytes) == spendingContract1Hash && OUTPUTS(1).value >= 2000L && blake2b256(OUTPUTS(1).propositionBytes) == spendingContract2Hash val withdrawCondition = HEIGHT >= 1000L && OUTPUTS(0).value >= 2500L && OUTPUTS(0).propositionBytes == pubkeyA.propBytes && OUTPUTS(1).value >= 2500L && OUTPUTS(1).propositionBytes == pubkeyB.propBytes && OUTPUTS(2).value >= 2500L && OUTPUTS(2).propositionBytes == pubkeyC.propBytes && OUTPUTS(3).value >= 2500L && OUTPUTS(3).propositionBytes == pubkeyD.propBytes (votingSuccess && properSpending) || withdrawCondition } This script in the ErgoScript is to be compiled into a syntax tree (which is to be written into the blockchain in a serialized form) by binding it with concrete values for variables ( pubkeyA , pubkeyB , pubkeyC , pubkeyD , spendingContract1Hash , spendingContract2Hash ). spendingContract1Hash is a hash of (serialized) equipment spending script which will be provided below, spendingContract2Hash is a hash of construction spending script. The equipment spending script is below: { val spendingSuccess = (pubkeyTool1 || pubkeyTool2 || pubkeyTool3 || pubkeyTool4) && businessKey val withdrawCondition = HEIGHT > 5000L && OUTPUTS(0).value >= 1250L && OUTPUTS(0).propositionBytes == pubkeyA.propBytes && OUTPUTS(1).value >= 1250L && OUTPUTS(1).propositionBytes == pubkeyB.propBytes && OUTPUTS(2).value >= 1250L && OUTPUTS(2).propositionBytes == pubkeyC.propBytes && OUTPUTS(3).value >= 1250L && OUTPUTS(3).propositionBytes == pubkeyD.propBytes spendingSuccess || withdrawCondition } And the construction script is: { val spendingSuccess = (pubkeyConstr1 || pubkeyConstr2 || pubkeyConstr3) && businessKey val withdrawCondition = HEIGHT > 5000L && OUTPUTS(0).value >= 500L && OUTPUTS(0).propositionBytes == pubkeyA.propBytes && OUTPUTS(1).value >= 500L && OUTPUTS(1).propositionBytes == pubkeyB.propBytes && OUTPUTS(2).value >= 500L && OUTPUTS(2).propositionBytes == pubkeyC.propBytes && OUTPUTS(3).value >= 500L && OUTPUTS(3).propositionBytes == pubkeyD.propBytes spendingSuccess || withdrawCondition } Now assume that the cooperative federation has created a coin protected by the voting contract. Below is how the entrepreneur can do his business: Create a transaction which consumes the coin and create at least three coins, one with equipment spending contract, another with construction spending contract, third is creating a coin protected by entrepreneur's public key. Send the transaction to the cooperatives, wait for the transaction with the threshold-signed input being published on the blockchain. Consider a contract with an equipment seller, co-sign a spending transaction. Consider a contract with a builder, co-sign a spending transaction. The entrepreneur can easily run away without doing any business, but with no more than 3,000 Ergs. This can be fixed, e.g. this money could be made spendable only after block number 5,000 , and before that money could be withdrawn by the cooperatives. For equipment and construction spendings, the entrepreneur is working along with some, presumably already reputable, business. Thus the investor is reducing its risks. You can find code and example transactions online . Please note that we have more examples of complex signature schemes, multi-step contracts (with on-the-go execution paths revealing, like MAST in Bitcoin, but with cycles allowed), oracles, crowdfunding and so on.

Ergo Blockchain\u2019s UTXO model allows multi-stage contracts to operate on a highly scalable network. Decentralized Finance The banking system is built solely on trust. However, this trust mechanism is a form of obligation that citizens don\u2019t have any choice on. Banks and financial institutions produce and provide financial products such as loans or ETFs to financial markets. The value of these products is defined by what they are referring to as an actual asset, either a physical object or a contract. The credibility of value, however, is protected with our blind trust in these institutions. Governments back up these financial institutions to restore confidence, but to what degree are they trustable ? The problem lies elsewhere. We don\u2019t ask if our stock is genuine or is it a fake duplicated one. Everything is working on a digital database, and we can see whether it is real. We can see our money in our bank account, but still, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s real. The modern monetary system works on a fractional banking system, so we know that only about 10% of the money in circulation is real money. We continue trusting financial institutions as if they hold some collateral against our money in banks. However, as we can see in history, during \u201cbanking panic runs\u201d or \u201cdebt crises\u201d, it\u2019s not easy to control a vast financial system and foresee these kinds of unexpected events. The outcome of this then usually affects the personal users rather than big institutions. Smart contracts are therefore built for this, to let you know where your money is at all times. Whatever application you use, if smart contracts govern it, then you know how your funds are secure. That\u2019s the beauty of a non-custodial financial system; you don\u2019t have to give your funds to a financial institution to use their services. You can use a variety of financial services without giving up custody of your funds. You don\u2019t have to pay abrupt fees to your bank to secure your funds. Not only that, but you can even make money using smart contracts by taking initiatives such as lending your funds or providing liquidity to markets. These are the strategies that blockchain envisions in a decentralized, peer-oriented, secure, and accessible financial system. Multi-Stage Contracts On Ergo So you\u2019ve heard about smart contracts, but what are multi-stage contracts? Multi-stage contracts refer to smart contracts that are operating on a stateful level. Because Ergo uses the UTXO model (first seen in Bitcoin), it is possible to process parallelized actions on top of smart contracts. Ethereum\u2019s Account-Based model , however, doesn\u2019t allow such operations. The Account-Based model has its ease of use, but it also comes with a high load of operation power. Ergo\u2019s multi-stage contracts are developed on the extended UTXO model. It\u2019s a complex design that aims for infinite scalability ; therefore, it creates more place to build complex solutions. For a blockchain to contain smart contracts, it should have loops. These loops can later refer to themselves and check whether an operation is working or not. Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO design is very primitive, and it doesn\u2019t contain Turing-complete smart contracts. Ethereum has this capability, but it\u2019s a primitive version of a Turing-complete language. Ergo Blockchain provides a different approach to multi-stage contracts, empowered by the extended UTXO model. Permitting a lighter network and broader use cases.

However, this trust mechanism is a form of obligation that citizens don\u2019t have any choice on. Banks and financial institutions produce and provide financial products such as loans or ETFs to financial markets. The value of these products is defined by what they are referring to as an actual asset, either a physical object or a contract. The credibility of value, however, is protected with our blind trust in these institutions. Governments back up these financial institutions to restore confidence, but to what degree are they trustable ? The problem lies elsewhere. We don\u2019t ask if our stock is genuine or is it a fake duplicated one. Everything is working on a digital database, and we can see whether it is real. We can see our money in our bank account, but still, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s real. The modern monetary system works on a fractional banking system, so we know that only about 10% of the money in circulation is real money. We continue trusting financial institutions as if they hold some collateral against our money in banks.

There is plenty of uniqueness in Ergo but the most significant is probably Sigma protocols. These allow a true P2P system with privacy in mind.

The overwhelming majority of successful public blockchain use\u2010cases are related to financial applications. Ergo extends Bitcoin's way of writing contracts by attaching a guard script (together with additional custom data) to every coin. For example, in addition to regular protection by some m\u2010of\u2010n signature, Ergo allows specifying the possible recipients of these coins, which may also be a contract with similar complex conditions. This \"chaining\" approach enables the implementation of secure and efficient contracts of arbitrary complexity. This, along with Ergo's focus on sustainability, makes it uniquely valuable as contractual money. Privacy must remain an option to protect the individual. It does not have to be forced; let people make their own choices. Privacy is the ability to create barriers and erect boundaries to create a space and for the individual. It is up to each what borders and boundaries they choose to make. Civilization exists under a continuous tension between what is best for society and what is best for the individual. The only real entities in a community are individuals. All collectives, associations, and governments stem from individual participation and interaction. Ergo utilizes the eUTXO model for enhanced privacy & scalability options while also employing expressive smart contracts for DeFi applications.

Zero-Knowledge Proof Intro Let\u2019s say someone picks up a phone in a bar. You can prove it\u2019s yours by hiding the screen, entering the unlock code and showing the unlocked screen to the person who found it. This is a simple example of a zero-knowledge proof: you have proven you own the phone without giving away any sensitive information. In cryptography, most practical problems are associated with secrets. The most popular application lies in digital signatures, used by millions of people around the world every day. Essentially, these involve saying: \u2018This message proves I know the private key associated with this public key \u2013 but I\u2019m not revealing the private key itself\u2019. Sigma protocols ErgoScript is the language used to specify the conditions under which currency can be spent. The language supports a type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs called \u03a3-protocols and is flexible enough to allow for ring-signatures, multisignatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computation.

But beyond that, Ergo allows partial swaps. Just like on a regular exchange, orders can be partially filled, if that\u2019s what the trader wants. This means it\u2019s possible to build a fully-fledged decentralised exchange (DEX) that enables cross-chain trading: a totally trustless version of existing crypto exchanges. There\u2019s no need for any gateways, token wrapping or other potential bottlenecks or points of failure. 'Optional' Privacy? A Rich smart-contract language and simplicity are the priority in Ergo, and smart-contracts make privacy a lot harder. There are plenty of reasons to want optional privacy - transparent ledgers are a feature for many use-cases. e.g. charities that want everyone to have full access to the flow of funds.

Few people are asking what DeFi should look like. Ergo has a vision for what the sector can become. 2020 is shaping up to be the year in which Decentralised Finance rose to mainstream attention, in the same way that Bitcoin and blockchain did in 2016 and 2017. In July alone, Total Value Locked \u2013 the amount of funds committed to DeFi dApps\u2019 smart contracts \u2013 doubled from $2 billion to $4 billion, largely driven by Compound\u2019s distribution of its COMP governance tokens. DeFi is all the rage, with several well-known projects pioneering the space before our eyes. But while the crypto world is gripped with the short-term opportunities of DeFi, fewer are talking about what it actually is \u2013 and fewer still about what it should be. In building a DeFi platform like Ergo, though, that\u2019s exactly the kind of question we have to ask. DeFi dislikes limits In talking about what DeFi \u2018should\u2019 be, it\u2019s easy to fall into a trap of being prescriptive, of introducing arbitrary conditions and limits. But that\u2019s not what blockchain is about. As we\u2019ve seen with Bitcoin and blockchain more generally, there\u2019s a free market of ideas and nothing is off the table. It\u2019s reasonable (though not particularly helpful) to say that DeFi should be \u2018anything and everything\u2019. Just like blockchain, DeFi brings advantages of transparency, immutability and efficiency (often including speed and/or cost) to financial processes. But in terms of what we believe this new set of technologies should offer, and what decentralised finance can bring to the conventional financial system, it\u2019s worth focusing the conversation on a few other key areas that have been overlooked or under-represented to date: Privacy, Scalability, Interoperability , and Decentralisation . 1. Privacy As Eric Hughes wrote in A Cypherpunk\u2019s Manifesto back in 1993, \u2018Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.\u2019 That is never more true than for financial privacy. Privacy must be a built-in feature of DeFi \u2013 not a bolt on extra or a desirable feature. It must be integral. But, as Hughes continues, \u2018Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.\u2019 There is always a balance to be struck between privacy and compliance, between transparency and anonymity. Large scale adoption of DeFi requires auditability, and the regulatory approval that enables. Thanks to the latest advances in zero-knowledge proofs, Ergo can offer both privacy and transparency, where required. The platform\u2019s Sigma Protocols offer robust, customisable cryptography \u2013 and, at the same time, the ability to selectively reveal information where necessary. 2. Scalability The ability to process thousands of transactions per second is also a non-negotiable feature for a thriving DeFi sector. How this is achieved is less important than that it is achieved; in practice, there will be many different approaches, with different users and protocols selecting the ones they prefer. For example, while we have seen the rise of sidechains and child chains, the reality is that exchanges remain a gateway to the blockchain world for a large proportion of users. Popular exchanges are increasingly integrating DeFi functionality, allowing their vast user bases to access it from their individual accounts, without interacting directly with the protocol. While this may be less than ideal from a security perspective, it\u2019s a simple reality that centralised services are not going out of fashion, but are integrating decentralised technologies thanks to the advantages they offer. Ergo has its own approach to scalability , but we can\u2019t and won\u2019t ignore the importance of businesses in driving forward user adoption. 3. Interoperability One of DeFi\u2019s key strengths is composability: the ability to build new applications from existing components, leveraging the network effect of established dApps and tokens. This is one of the main factors that has enabled TVL to explode over the past month. But composability currently has its limits. Cross-platform composability currently isn\u2019t possible. Even atomic swaps \u2013 the first stage of interoperability \u2013 are in their infancy, though Ergo is working on an atomic swap-powered DEX . Full interoperability means the ability for a user to execute a smart contract on one platform and have it seamlessly interact with another blockchain. This would allow truly frictionless cross-protocol interaction, and is what is needed to enable the flow of liquidity fully throughout the DeFi world. At that point, applications become blockchain agnostic, and the platforms are really more like the programming languages for accessing dApps\u2019 functionality. 4. Decentralisation Lastly, and specifically in the context of scalability and interoperability, we cannot forget the importance of decentralisation \u2013 something Ergo has always taken seriously . Of course DeFi is decentralised \u2013 but there are different types of decentralisation. Ethereum, the home of almost every major DeFi dApp, is just one platform. Ethereum\u2019s developers are working on a plan for scaling, but even if this is successful, it is still one blockchain. Should we entrust all our funds to one network? What if a critical bug or exploit is found? Interoperability does more than enable cross-chain liquidity. It decentralises the decentralised infrastructure for DeFi, adding layers of redundancy and security. In the process, it strengthens every blockchain that is a part of that ecosystem, creating a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. At a time when relatively large blockchains still suffer double spend attacks and serious reorgs , and catastrophic vulnerabilities are found in smart contracts holding tens of millions of dollars of value, we cannot assume that one single blockchain will or should rule them all. As blockchain technology gains traction, central bank digital currencies are among the most significant applications being developed. But these will inevitably fall far short of the ideal, for one simple reason: control. In particular, that has implications for composability and privacy, and much else besides. Central bank digital currencies are no longer a theoretical application of blockchain technology. The list of countries developing CBDCs is growing rapidly, with several now trialing state-backed digital cash. CDBCs are not built on classic, open blockchain technology. While there are various approaches, they are all based on permissioned ledgers that restrict the role of securing the network and processing transactions to a group of approved entities. They also include a control layer that gives administrators the ability to intervene in transactions, blocking or reversing those they deem invalid. It\u2019s a far cry from the ideals of Bitcoin, and the Ergo platform that aims to build on these. But it\u2019s only to be expected. The state has a role and a remit, and it\u2019s unlikely to give up the control it exercises. Unfortunately, though, there are two ways that holding onto control will mean that CBDCs fall far short of what they could be, meaning they may ultimately cede ground to open platforms like Ergo. Composability As we wrote in a recent blog, composability is a core feature of DeFi. It\u2019s what gives applications network effect, instantly adding value by plugging into existing dapps\u2019 user bases and functionality. Programmable money is a huge development. The current system is clunky and complicated to use, at best. It\u2019s not possible to attach detailed conditions to transactions, and have them interact seamlessly with software, as can be done with blockchain and smart contracts. Imagine the value that could be unlocked if CBDCs were programmable, and smart cash could be integrated frictionlessly into new applications \u2013 banking interfaces, investment services, stores, social networks, games. The list is endless. But this is hardly likely. The freedom to program money will exist, for many years at least, in the open blockchain space alone. Privacy Secondly, we consider privacy to be a core requirement of DeFi. Money is too important to be used as a tool of surveillance, but there is no question that this is what it will become as soon as the first CBDCs are rolled out to a large user base. China is one of the furthest ahead in its creation of state-backed digital cash. This is a state that is notorious for its internet censorship and online surveillance of its population. Its human rights record is dire, and in recent days we have learned more about its oppression of the Uighur minority. Moreover, China already uses a social credit system, which grants or denies citizens access to certain services and amenities depending on their social score, with model citizens enjoying greater privileges. There is, again, no question that a state-backed, traceable CBDC will be used as a tool of surveillance on a scale that is unprecedented in human history. And it will be the same across any nation that implements money within the same framework. That giant eye on the dollar bill? You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. Private, programmable financial services Ergo has a very different vision for blockchain-based cash and financial services. In the new paradigm of blockchain, value is not retained by constraining it. It is only maximised through open systems that make it as accessible as people want it to be. Money without borders, in both senses: cash that can be programmed, sent and received freely but privately, between any two individuals or organisations \u2013 and even blockchains \u2013 anywhere in the world. This is what money needs to be, and what Ergo is building. This is the first in a series of articles speculating on how the fast-emerging DeFi sector might evolve in the coming years. The DeFi movement as it currently exists is only a few months old, and blockchain itself has barely existed a decade. Already, though, we are beginning to see themes crystallising and the first popular use cases becoming established. As a DeFi platform that takes positioning for the future seriously, it\u2019s important that Ergo has a vision \u2013 not only a sense of where things might be heading, but the role that it should itself be playing as these new decentralised financial services consolidate and grow in popularity. While no one can know the future, least of all in this space, a number of trends, technologies, products and use cases are emerging, and it seems that these are starting to plot a certain trajectory. Allowing for necessary course correction as time goes on, where might we see DeFi end up in ten years? Tokens will be the fuel for DeFi, and everything will be tokenised One of the major themes that was becoming apparent, long before the yield farming craze brought DeFi to global attention, is tokenisation. We already have blockchain tokens representing cryptocurrencies and digital assets, and the first shares and other securities have been issued on the blockchain. The benefits are such that the direction of travel is clear. Sooner or later, everything will end up as tokens. For regular, fungible (interchangeable) assets, a regular token will work. Fiat and cryptocurrencies, shares, bonds, precious metals, ETFs, CBDCs \u2013 these will all be freely available on the blockchain. For other assets, NFTs will proliferate. When you buy a car, house, painting or other unique item of value, whether digital or physical, there\u2019s a good chance that transaction will also include a blockchain token. These tokenised assets will place on the blockchain trillions of dollars of value that are currently \u2018stuck\u2019 offline, illiquid or impossible to buy or sell outside of certain limited circles and circumstances. This pool of tokenised value will represent the fuel of the Defi economy: assets that can be traded frictionlessly, borrowed against and leveraged using decentralised protocols that probably won\u2019t look so very different to the ones we use today. Digital identity will become non-negotiable Since these assets will be tradeable on centralised and decentralised exchanges, digital identity will also become an increasingly important theme. This will link blockchain addresses with offline identities, enabling individuals and corporations to operate in a way that is compliant with relevant regulation. It will also allow the automation of tax and accounting processes. To date, digital identity has been an overlooked element of the DeFi ecosystem \u2013 likely due to the use of centralised platforms that can conduct KYC as a condition of use. We\u2019re fast approaching a point where that is no longer a given, with the growth of new forms of decentralised exchange and the increase in volumes moving to these platforms. Stablecoins will become embedded elements of the blockchain One of the biggest use cases for DeFi \u2013 and again one that is often overlooked \u2013 is stablecoins. These exist in many forms, and rely on a range of approaches: centralised and decentralised, collateralised and algorithmic, fiat-backed, and so on. Whatever your preferred approach or view of stablecoins, they are here to stay. They have found use cases as a store of value, especially for traders, and as a popular form of collateral for yield farming. What they haven\u2019t been widely adopted for, yet, is as an integral part of blockchain infrastructure. Transaction fees are almost always paid for with the native blockchain token. Not only does this fluctuate in value, but so does the amount of it required per transaction, depending on both the complexity of the transaction itself and competition for space in the next block. Clearly, this complexity is not conducive to mainstream adoption. End users are best served by simplicity, with minimal burdens for managing multiple tokens. They will want to pay transaction fees in a stable unit of account, and not have to worry about handling the native blockchain token. The solution? An integrated stablecoin that, to most end users, is the most important token on the platform. Two-tier system As a result of this need, it seems likely that we may start to see a two-tier system evolve more clearly. A blockchain such as Ergo will have a native token, which will serve as the underlying currency of payment, just as occurs now. For the most part, though, these will only be handled by more experienced users. These expert users will maintain the technical and financial infrastructure of the DeFi space. For example, they will mine and use the native token as collateral to create a stablecoin, which can be sold into the market for general use, in return for tokenised assets of all kinds. Regular users will then use the \u2018native stablecoin\u2019 in all their business, as a kind of standard reserve currency. It will be used to buy other assets; it will be lent to users against other tokenised assets as collateral (houses, cars, real estate and much more); and it will be used to pay transaction fees. The miners who receive this native stablecoin can hold it as it is, to pay for electricity and hardware costs, or they can convert it back to the platform token or other assets \u2013 that is up to them. These are just some of the themes we are starting to see emerging in the DeFi world, and how they might develop over time. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll explore various other ideas as the space continues to evolve and Ergo launches new technology.","title":"dApp dev"},{"location":"dev/start/resources/","text":"Resources Explorer Explorer Mainnet explorer Testnet Testnet explorer Using Ergo-Testnet Testnet Faucet API API Docs Node API Explorer API Misc.

However, in complex cases it has some problems: hints generated (such as commitments) were not tied to a position of a sub-expression in a sigma-expression. For example, for statement like \"atLeast(2, Coll(pkAlice, pkBob, pkCharlie)) && (pkBob || pkDiana)\", the same commitment would be generated for Bob. Which is improper and insecure at all - a signature would reveal Bob's secret key (as the same randomness used twice for different challenges in Schnorr protocols). similarly, hints generated were not tied to inputs. This is fixed with new API introduced in distributed-sigs branch. Now all the hints tied with input indexes and also with positions in sigma-tree after script reduction with current context. Also, API is now simpler-to-use I suppose. So let me provide a new tutorial on collective signing. Like in the previous tutorial, first we pay to 2-out-of-3 spending script (with keys stored in registers): { val pkA = SELF.R4[GroupElement].get val pkB = SELF.R5[GroupElement].get val pkC = SELF.R6[GroupElement].get atLeast(2, Coll(proveDlog(pkA), proveDlog(pkB), proveDlog(pkC))) } Then, when a transaction is confirmed (https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/71aa67f95e96827193bdf711f6ccf41b30ef8bbbdaef63ed672dfb7420a4c314) , we get output bytes via /utxo/byIdBinary/{boxId} . Then we generate an unsigned transaction by providing inputs directly, in our example, by providing the following input to /wallet/transaction/generateUnsigned : { \"requests\": [ { \"address\": \"4MQyML64GnzMxZgm\", \"value\": 999000000 } ], \"fee\": 1000000, \"inputsRaw\": [ \"8094ebdc0310010404987300830308cde4c6a70407cde4c6a70507cde4c6a706079a8f1300030702b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f070354efc32652cad6cf1231be987afa29a686af30b5735995e3ce51339c4d0ca380070235647199b150d8fab315d74e44b78866787d0330241fd471f98bf6c2bffe1e8d71aa67f95e96827193bdf711f6ccf41b30ef8bbbdaef63ed672dfb7420a4c31400\" ], \"dataInputsRaw\": [ ] } Then Alice generates commitments for the unsigned transaction by sending it to the NEW /wallet/generateCommitments (additional secrets to be used along with wallet's can be provided also), and in the output she's getting both secret and public hints: { \"secretHints\": { \"0\": [ { \"type\": \"dlog\", \"a\": \"03c855c50d173f1b0e2797390b71d82023dcb8e12950e4fa0b9ae3be17bacca2a1\", \"pubkey\": { \"op\": -51, \"h\": \"02b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f\" }, \"position\": \"0-0\", \"hint\": \"cmtWithSecret\", \"secret\": \"...\" } ] }, \"publicHints\": { \"0\": [ { \"type\": \"dlog\", \"a\": \"03c855c50d173f1b0e2797390b71d82023dcb8e12950e4fa0b9ae3be17bacca2a1\", \"pubkey\": { \"op\": -51, \"h\": \"02b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f\" }, \"position\": \"0-0\", \"hint\": \"cmtReal\" } ] } } (secret randomness is omitted to avoid private key extraction). Then Alice must store secret hints locally and provide public to Bob.

generated signed valid transaction can be broadcasted. Taken from the forum post Improved distributed signatures ~ Sept, 2020 Let\u2019s sign collectively! Distributed signatures API It is well-known (among hardcore Ergonauts) that Ergo Platform has support for variety of composeable and efficient zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge in its authentication language. In particular, it provides possibility for ring and threshold signatures preserving zero-knowledge, so, for example, by observing 2-out-of-3 threshold signature associated with public keys of (Alice, Bob, Carol) on the blockchain, it is not possible to figure out who were those two parties who signed. While Ergo Platform protocol supports threshold and ring signatures since day one, concrete applications doing signing were not available eventually. First, the ErgoMix implementations (by @anon92048 and then @anon2020s ) are using kind of ring signature hiding a spending path. And recently EIP-11 was introduced which is about adding support for distributed signing to the reference client (and not only). The implementation of EIP-11 is mostly done in this PR and in I'm going to explain how to use new API method First, let's make a script for a box protected with 2-out-of-3 threshold signature. One option is about to hardcode public keys in the script, I've chosen another way, namely, to put public keys of signers into registers: { val pkA = SELF.R4[GroupElement].get val pkB = SELF.R5[GroupElement].get val pkC = SELF.R6[GroupElement].get atLeast(2, Coll(proveDlog(pkA), proveDlog(pkB), proveDlog(pkC))) } . Then we need to lock money with concrete keys. It seems the node Swagger API is the most convenient way to do that, e.g. by posting the following payment request to /wallet/payment/send: [ { \"address\": \"umRXw8E7PmdHbswncxFe3jmE51oGFzL4CqfZYfiRr4aL\", \"value\": 1000000000, \"registers\": { \"R4\": \"0702b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f\", \"R5\": \"070354efc32652cad6cf1231be987afa29a686af30b5735995e3ce51339c4d0ca380\", \"R6\": \"070235647199b150d8fab315d74e44b78866787d0330241fd471f98bf6c2bffe1e8d\" } } ] (use /utils/addressToRaw/{address} method to get encoded points from P2PK addresses shown by the wallet and prepend group element type descriptor \"07\" then). Thus we're getting the following box, for example (output #0): https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/0ffc5ba326262f25016c59c58a34b2f7fed2ea1b69f8f007d270f6ef07bced49 . We can get binary representation of unspent box via /utxo/byIdBinary API method, e.g. utxo/byIdBinary/f1892011ed31b8e51f3f3ae44f6d9132070343a7bf6db61b3342696a7873a085 gives us: \"8094ebdc0310010404987300830308cde4c6a70407cde4c6a70507cde4c6a70607abdd0f00030702b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f070354efc32652cad6cf1231be987afa29a686af30b5735995e3ce51339c4d0ca380070235647199b150d8fab315d74e44b78866787d0330241fd471f98bf6c2bffe1e8d0ffc5ba326262f25016c59c58a34b2f7fed2ea1b69f8f007d270f6ef07bced4900\" We use first two keys for signing (as it is 2-out-of). Please note that members of the signing ring know (and choose) who's signing and who will be simulated. Let's assume that the first key belongs to Alice, and the second key belongs to Bob. The the signing procedure could be as follows: First, Alice generates secret randomness and public commitment to it by posting the following request to /script/generateCommitment : { \"op\": -51, \"h\": \"02b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f\" } result is : { \"r\": \"...\", \"a\": \"02c103443ab26655a1ef36f44643700cc5f4730a2a1830085dda1072ccfb30940f\" } (\"r\" is omitted to avoid private key recovery) She sends then \"a\" value to Bob along with unsigned transaction generated via /wallet/transaction/generateUnsigned. Now Bob is generating invalid (partial) signature by sending the following signing request to /wallet/transaction/sign with Alice's commitment included as hint: { \"tx\": { \"id\": \"ebafdd3a00bd3d9aa26be4056c4f742e9cb0702cce9864567aa4e34cda185d54\", \"inputs\": [ { \"boxId\": \"f1892011ed31b8e51f3f3ae44f6d9132070343a7bf6db61b3342696a7873a085\", \"extension\": {} } ], \"dataInputs\": [], \"outputs\": [ { \"boxId\": \"49974195f916dcc95e94c72bcf6e90200bbf2c06e5cc7a22a505bad1da77927d\", \"value\": 999000000, \"ergoTree\": \"10010101d17300\", \"assets\": [], \"creationHeight\": 257748, \"additionalRegisters\": {}, \"transactionId\": \"ebafdd3a00bd3d9aa26be4056c4f742e9cb0702cce9864567aa4e34cda185d54\", \"index\": 0 }, { \"boxId\": \"096192e25b691697b5afdd4a5cf39c69b84fba8b483f475c2e2d3cf47758abb1\", \"value\": 1000000, \"ergoTree\": \"1005040004000e36100204a00b08cd0279be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798ea02d192a39a8cc7a701730073011001020402d19683030193a38cc7b2a57300000193c2b2a57301007473027303830108cdeeac93b1a57304\", \"assets\": [], \"creationHeight\": 257748, \"additionalRegisters\": {}, \"transactionId\": \"ebafdd3a00bd3d9aa26be4056c4f742e9cb0702cce9864567aa4e34cda185d54\", \"index\": 1 } ] }, \"secrets\": { \"dlog\": [ ], \"dht\": [ ] }, \"hints\": [ { \"hint\": \"cmtReal\", \"type\": \"dlog\", \"pubkey\":{ \"op\": -51, \"h\": \"02b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f\" }, \"a\": \"02c103443ab26655a1ef36f44643700cc5f4730a2a1830085dda1072ccfb30940f\" } ] } Bob is sending transaction with invalid signature to Alice.

Still, the code is not finalized (\"op\": -51 looks ugly, however, it was done previously) and not user-friendly, so as a next step, some applications working with the API are needed. - Let\u2019s sign collectively! Distributed signatures API ~ June, 2020","title":"API"},{"location":"node/api/#improved-distributed-signatures","text":"Initial implementation of distributed signatures support in the node worked well in simple cases, and ZK Treasury built on top of it. However, in complex cases it has some problems: hints generated (such as commitments) were not tied to a position of a sub-expression in a sigma-expression. For example, for statement like \"atLeast(2, Coll(pkAlice, pkBob, pkCharlie)) && (pkBob || pkDiana)\", the same commitment would be generated for Bob. Which is improper and insecure at all - a signature would reveal Bob's secret key (as the same randomness used twice for different challenges in Schnorr protocols). similarly, hints generated were not tied to inputs. This is fixed with new API introduced in distributed-sigs branch. Now all the hints tied with input indexes and also with positions in sigma-tree after script reduction with current context. Also, API is now simpler-to-use I suppose. So let me provide a new tutorial on collective signing. Like in the previous tutorial, first we pay to 2-out-of-3 spending script (with keys stored in registers): { val pkA = SELF.R4[GroupElement].get val pkB = SELF.R5[GroupElement].get val pkC = SELF.R6[GroupElement].get atLeast(2, Coll(proveDlog(pkA), proveDlog(pkB), proveDlog(pkC))) } Then, when a transaction is confirmed (https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/71aa67f95e96827193bdf711f6ccf41b30ef8bbbdaef63ed672dfb7420a4c314) , we get output bytes via /utxo/byIdBinary/{boxId} . Then we generate an unsigned transaction by providing inputs directly, in our example, by providing the following input to /wallet/transaction/generateUnsigned : { \"requests\": [ { \"address\": \"4MQyML64GnzMxZgm\", \"value\": 999000000 } ], \"fee\": 1000000, \"inputsRaw\": [ \"8094ebdc0310010404987300830308cde4c6a70407cde4c6a70507cde4c6a706079a8f1300030702b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f070354efc32652cad6cf1231be987afa29a686af30b5735995e3ce51339c4d0ca380070235647199b150d8fab315d74e44b78866787d0330241fd471f98bf6c2bffe1e8d71aa67f95e96827193bdf711f6ccf41b30ef8bbbdaef63ed672dfb7420a4c31400\" ], \"dataInputsRaw\": [ ] } Then Alice generates commitments for the unsigned transaction by sending it to the NEW /wallet/generateCommitments (additional secrets to be used along with wallet's can be provided also), and in the output she's getting both secret and public hints: { \"secretHints\": { \"0\": [ { \"type\": \"dlog\", \"a\": \"03c855c50d173f1b0e2797390b71d82023dcb8e12950e4fa0b9ae3be17bacca2a1\", \"pubkey\": { \"op\": -51, \"h\": \"02b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f\" }, \"position\": \"0-0\", \"hint\": \"cmtWithSecret\", \"secret\": \"...\" } ] }, \"publicHints\": { \"0\": [ { \"type\": \"dlog\", \"a\": \"03c855c50d173f1b0e2797390b71d82023dcb8e12950e4fa0b9ae3be17bacca2a1\", \"pubkey\": { \"op\": -51, \"h\": \"02b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f\" }, \"position\": \"0-0\", \"hint\": \"cmtReal\" } ] } } (secret randomness is omitted to avoid private key extraction).

generated signed valid transaction can be broadcasted. Taken from the forum post Improved distributed signatures ~ Sept, 2020","title":"Improved distributed signatures"},{"location":"node/api/#lets-sign-collectively-distributed-signatures-api","text":"It is well-known (among hardcore Ergonauts) that Ergo Platform has support for variety of composeable and efficient zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge in its authentication language. In particular, it provides possibility for ring and threshold signatures preserving zero-knowledge, so, for example, by observing 2-out-of-3 threshold signature associated with public keys of (Alice, Bob, Carol) on the blockchain, it is not possible to figure out who were those two parties who signed. While Ergo Platform protocol supports threshold and ring signatures since day one, concrete applications doing signing were not available eventually. First, the ErgoMix implementations (by @anon92048 and then @anon2020s ) are using kind of ring signature hiding a spending path. And recently EIP-11 was introduced which is about adding support for distributed signing to the reference client (and not only). The implementation of EIP-11 is mostly done in this PR and in I'm going to explain how to use new API method First, let's make a script for a box protected with 2-out-of-3 threshold signature. One option is about to hardcode public keys in the script, I've chosen another way, namely, to put public keys of signers into registers: { val pkA = SELF.R4[GroupElement].get val pkB = SELF.R5[GroupElement].get val pkC = SELF.R6[GroupElement].get atLeast(2, Coll(proveDlog(pkA), proveDlog(pkB), proveDlog(pkC))) } . Then we need to lock money with concrete keys. It seems the node Swagger API is the most convenient way to do that, e.g. by posting the following payment request to /wallet/payment/send: [ { \"address\": \"umRXw8E7PmdHbswncxFe3jmE51oGFzL4CqfZYfiRr4aL\", \"value\": 1000000000, \"registers\": { \"R4\": \"0702b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f\", \"R5\": \"070354efc32652cad6cf1231be987afa29a686af30b5735995e3ce51339c4d0ca380\", \"R6\": \"070235647199b150d8fab315d74e44b78866787d0330241fd471f98bf6c2bffe1e8d\" } } ] (use /utils/addressToRaw/{address} method to get encoded points from P2PK addresses shown by the wallet and prepend group element type descriptor \"07\" then). Thus we're getting the following box, for example (output #0): https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/0ffc5ba326262f25016c59c58a34b2f7fed2ea1b69f8f007d270f6ef07bced49 . We can get binary representation of unspent box via /utxo/byIdBinary API method, e.g. utxo/byIdBinary/f1892011ed31b8e51f3f3ae44f6d9132070343a7bf6db61b3342696a7873a085 gives us: \"8094ebdc0310010404987300830308cde4c6a70407cde4c6a70507cde4c6a70607abdd0f00030702b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f070354efc32652cad6cf1231be987afa29a686af30b5735995e3ce51339c4d0ca380070235647199b150d8fab315d74e44b78866787d0330241fd471f98bf6c2bffe1e8d0ffc5ba326262f25016c59c58a34b2f7fed2ea1b69f8f007d270f6ef07bced4900\" We use first two keys for signing (as it is 2-out-of). Please note that members of the signing ring know (and choose) who's signing and who will be simulated. Let's assume that the first key belongs to Alice, and the second key belongs to Bob. The the signing procedure could be as follows: First, Alice generates secret randomness and public commitment to it by posting the following request to /script/generateCommitment : { \"op\": -51, \"h\": \"02b353df14cd94849c36194bba03000dafaeb91b3a425a863f5660565189ddfe8f\" } result is : { \"r\": \"...\", \"a\": \"02c103443ab26655a1ef36f44643700cc5f4730a2a1830085dda1072ccfb30940f\" } (\"r\" is omitted to avoid private key recovery) She sends then \"a\" value to Bob along with unsigned transaction generated via /wallet/transaction/generateUnsigned.

The following describes how to set up and protect your Ergo wallet. The wallet uses the BIP39 standard to generate a seed from a mnemonic sentence, which is then used to generate the private keys according to the BIP32 standard (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets). You can use your own mnemonic sentence composed of the words from one of these wordists if you want to. The allowed sentence lengths are 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 representing respectively, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256 bits of security. In order to initialize a wallet with such a mnemonic, you should use the wallet/restore API endpoint. However, it is far more secure to use the mneomnic generated by the wallet. At this stage, all interactions with the wallet can only be done through the node's REST API. Please ensure that you have set an API key in your node before performing the next steps. Configuring the wallet The wallet is configured through the node configuration file. Below are the configuration parameters worth paying attention to when configuring wallet for the first time: ergo.wallet.seedStrengthBits - Bit-length of a seed in case it will be generated by the node. Note: the stronger the seed the longer the mnemonic sentence length is. Options: 128, 160, 192, 224, 256 ergo.wallet.secretStorage.secretDir - Directory where secret will be stored in encrypted form ergo.wallet.mnemonicPhraseLanguage - Language to be used in mnemonic sentence. Options: \"chinese_simplified\", \"chinese_traditional\", \"english\", \"french\", \"italian\", \"japanese\", \"korean\", \"spanish\" Using the wallet for the first time The wallet needs to be initialized via the REST API when running the node for the first time. Two options are available here: Initialize it from scratch (seed will be generated by the node) by making a POST request to /wallet/init with data body: {\"pass\": \"123\", \"mnemonicPass\": \"abc\"} . Don't forget to save the mnemonic phrase that the node responds with . (Note: The parameter mnemonicPass in request body is optional and is used for protecting the mnemonic phrase). Restore the wallet from an existing seed. You will have to provide your mnemonic phrase When using this option. This is done by making a POST request to /wallet/restore with data body: {\"pass\": \"123\", \"mnemonic\": \"abandon abandon ...\", \"mnemonicPass\": \"abc\"} (Note: the mnemonicPass field is required only in case your mnemonic phrase was protected by an additional password at creation). Unlocking the wallet After initialization and before every use the wallet needs to be unlocked by making a POST request to /wallet/unlock with data body: {\"pass\": \"123\"} . (Note: use the password you had chosen at initialization stage) You must perform this step every time the node is restarted or the wallet is locked. In particular, the wallet must be unlocked for the following operations: Using internal miner Signing transactions Tracking boxes Locking the wallet A wallet is automatically locked after some time, which means that all currently loaded secrets are flushed from the memory. You can also use the REST API to lock the wallet by making a GET request to /wallet/lock . It is recommended to lock the wallet when it is not in use. After locking, you will need to unlock the wallet to use it again. Managing keys A wallet implements BIP32 (\"Hierarchical deterministic wallets\"). When the wallet is initialized the only root key is created. In order to derive additional key pair corresponding to a specific derivation path (method: POST, request body: {\"derivationPath\": \"m/1/2\"} ) the /wallet/deriveKey API route can be used.

There is also another one root section scorex that holds the parameters inherited from the Scorex project . Using parameter directory it is possible to set a path to the base application directory. It is also possible to use environment variables to override configuration parameters. For example, by default the base directory is being constructed relatively to the user's HOME environment variable. Please do not enclose references to environment variables into quotation marks, otherwise they will be handled as strings and won't be resolved. Network settings In scorex.network section P2P network related settings could be set. Using declaredAddress parameter you can set the external IP address and port number of the node. It's necessary to work behind NAT in most cloud hosting, where the machine does not interface directly with the external address. If you do not specify it, then your node connects to the P2P network, but it won't listen to incoming connections so other nodes will not be able to connect. Other nodes are connected to your node using these data. The format of this parameter is \"[ip-address]:[port]\". Using parameter bindAddress you can set the IP address of local network interface on which Ergo Node will accept incoming connections. By default, node binds to \"0.0.0.0\" that means that it will listen on all available network adapters. Note about Internet Address settings Internet Address settings have <ip-adderss>:<port> format. Note the <port> part at the very end of the address after the colon. For the bindAddress setting port part is used to set the network port number to which other Ergo nodes will connect. Please ensure that the port is reachable from outside, otherwise your node will have only outgoing connections to P2P network. If the given port is taken by other application, your node won't start. Parameter nodeName could be used to set the name of your node visible to other participants of the P2P network. The name transmitted during initial handshake. In the default configuration, this parameter is commented out, which leads to random name generation. The knownPeers parameter stores the list of bootstrap nodes to which your node will establish outgoing connections while initializing. Note about time settings All time span parameters are set in milliseconds. You can also use duration units to shorten their values. Supported units are: * s, second, seconds * m, minute, minutes * h, hour, hours * d, day, days For usage examples see the default configuration file above. Use maxConnections parameter to set the maximum number of simultaneous connections handled by the node. Parameter connectionTimeout could be used to change the network communication timeout. Using handshakeTimeout parameter it is possible to set time period to wait for reply during handshake. In case of no reply the peer will be blacklisted. Using parameters that starts with upnp you can configure the UPnP settings. Actually, those settings are useful only if you ran your Ergo node on the home network where the node could ask your router to establish a tunnel. By default, this functionality is disabled. Use upnpEnabled parameter to enable this functionality. Wallet settings In wallet section you can configure the wallet built in Ergo node. Use dlogSecretsNumber parameter to specify how many Schorr secret keys (w for the g^w public key) to generate. Use scanningInterval parameter to set an interval of re-scaning uncertain boxes. Using seed parameter you could recreate an existing walled on a new node. If you don't have any existing wallet comment out this parameter and start the node. During the first run, the application will create a new wallet with a random seed for you. In this case, the seed will be displayed in the application log. Attention! The wallet is a critical part of your node. You should better store wallet's file in a safe and protected location. Don't forget to backup your wallet's file. It's recommended to remove the seed from the configuration file immediately after the start of the node. If an attacker gains access to this seed string, he has access to all your funds on all your addresses! Blockchain settings At ergo.chain you can select or custom the blockchain parameters. Use blockInterval parameter to set desired time interval between blocks. Parameter epochLength used to set the length of an epoch in difficulty recalculation. 1 means difficulty recalculation every block useLastEpochs parameter stores a number of last epochs that will be used for difficulty recalculation. You can change the PoW algo or related parameters using powScheme section. Node settings In section ergo.node it is possible to configure parameters of the node regime. Use enable parameter to enable or disable block generation on the node. By default, it's disabled. Node with disabled offlineGeneration parameter will start mining as soon as it connects to the first peer in the P2P network. Setting this parameter to true will enable off-line generation. Using miningDelay parameter you can tune your node's mining delay after finding a new block. REST API settings In section scorex.rest-api you can set the node's REST API parameters. Parameter bindAddress could be used to select network interface on which REST API will accept incoming connections. The :<port> part could be used to change the port number, which REST API will listen for connections. Attention! For the better security, do not change bindAddress from \"127.0.0.1\" if you do not know what you're doing! For the external access you should use Nginx's proxy_pass module or SSH port-forwarding instead. Use api-key-hash parameter to set the hash of your API key.

Using declaredAddress parameter you can set the external IP address and port number of the node. It's necessary to work behind NAT in most cloud hosting, where the machine does not interface directly with the external address. If you do not specify it, then your node connects to the P2P network, but it won't listen to incoming connections so other nodes will not be able to connect. Other nodes are connected to your node using these data. The format of this parameter is \"[ip-address]:[port]\". Using parameter bindAddress you can set the IP address of local network interface on which Ergo Node will accept incoming connections. By default, node binds to \"0.0.0.0\" that means that it will listen on all available network adapters. Note about Internet Address settings Internet Address settings have <ip-adderss>:<port> format. Note the <port> part at the very end of the address after the colon. For the bindAddress setting port part is used to set the network port number to which other Ergo nodes will connect. Please ensure that the port is reachable from outside, otherwise your node will have only outgoing connections to P2P network. If the given port is taken by other application, your node won't start. Parameter nodeName could be used to set the name of your node visible to other participants of the P2P network. The name transmitted during initial handshake. In the default configuration, this parameter is commented out, which leads to random name generation. The knownPeers parameter stores the list of bootstrap nodes to which your node will establish outgoing connections while initializing. Note about time settings All time span parameters are set in milliseconds. You can also use duration units to shorten their values. Supported units are: * s, second, seconds * m, minute, minutes * h, hour, hours * d, day, days For usage examples see the default configuration file above. Use maxConnections parameter to set the maximum number of simultaneous connections handled by the node. Parameter connectionTimeout could be used to change the network communication timeout. Using handshakeTimeout parameter it is possible to set time period to wait for reply during handshake. In case of no reply the peer will be blacklisted. Using parameters that starts with upnp you can configure the UPnP settings. Actually, those settings are useful only if you ran your Ergo node on the home network where the node could ask your router to establish a tunnel. By default, this functionality is disabled. Use upnpEnabled parameter to enable this functionality. Wallet settings In wallet section you can configure the wallet built in Ergo node. Use dlogSecretsNumber parameter to specify how many Schorr secret keys (w for the g^w public key) to generate. Use scanningInterval parameter to set an interval of re-scaning uncertain boxes. Using seed parameter you could recreate an existing walled on a new node. If you don't have any existing wallet comment out this parameter and start the node. During the first run, the application will create a new wallet with a random seed for you. In this case, the seed will be displayed in the application log. Attention! The wallet is a critical part of your node. You should better store wallet's file in a safe and protected location. Don't forget to backup your wallet's file. It's recommended to remove the seed from the configuration file immediately after the start of the node. If an attacker gains access to this seed string, he has access to all your funds on all your addresses! Blockchain settings At ergo.chain you can select or custom the blockchain parameters. Use blockInterval parameter to set desired time interval between blocks. Parameter epochLength used to set the length of an epoch in difficulty recalculation. 1 means difficulty recalculation every block useLastEpochs parameter stores a number of last epochs that will be used for difficulty recalculation.

It does not cover mining. Windows users can also watch the video tutorial. Node security There are a few important aspects of node usage that your wallet and money's safety depends on: * An Ergo node requires storing security-critical parameters in the configuration file. You should never make this file public. * An Ergo node provides a REST API for interacting with the built-in wallet. Sensitive API methods require a security token, which should never be sent over untrusted channels. * Access to the Ergo REST API must be restricted to known hosts. In particular, the API must not be accessible from the Internet. Prerequisites To run an Ergo node you need a JDK/JRE version >= 9 installed on your system. We recommend either version 9 or 11. One way to do this is to install Oracle Java SE . Note that Oracle JDK/JRE <= 8 is no longer supported . The next step is to download the latest Ergo client release jar file and create a node configuration file. Note that instead of downloading the precompiled Ergo jar, you can clone the repository and compile the jar from the source using SBT by issuing the sbt assembly command. Create a dedicated folder (such as ~/ergo ) for running the node. Denote by ergo_folder the folder where the jar is kept. Running the node for the first time Create a configuration file ergo.conf with the following text in ergo_folder . ergo { node { mining = false } } Open a command prompt and cd to ergo_folder . Then issue the following command to run the node for the first time: java -jar ergo-<release>.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf The node will start syncing immediately after this. Wait for a few minutes for the API to start and go to the next step. Note: You can use any name for the file instead of ergo.conf . All configuration parameters are to be passed through this file and you only need to rewrite parameters that you want to change from the default values. The above config file actually has the default values. Compute the hash of your secret First, select a secret to protect your API. Then go to http://127.0.0.1:9053/swagger#/utils/hashBlake2b and call the API to compute the hash of your secret. Refer to the image below. Copy the response containing the hash for use in the next step (see below image). In our example, the secret is hello whose hash corresponds to 324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf . IMPORTANT You must use a different and strong secret. Update config file with API key hash Edit the config file ergo.conf and paste the hash copied in the previous step. The file should look as follows: ergo { node { mining = false } } scorex { restApi { # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key. # Should be 64-chars long Base16 string. # below is the hash of the string 'hello' # replace with your actual hash apiKeyHash = \"324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf\" } } Initialize wallet Restart the node and go to http://127.0.0.1:9053/panel to access the panel. Then set the API key secret from the previous step. Note that you need to set the secret and not the hash from the config file. In our example, this is the string hello . Click on Initialize wallet . After the pop-up opens, there are two ways to proceed depending on your scenario. If this is the first time you are running the node then you need to initialize it with a new mnemonic sentence. If you had created a wallet earlier and would like to obtain the same address (possibly because there are funds stored in it), then you have to restore the wallet using the mnemonic sentence you had saved earlier. Follow one of the below steps depending on your situation. Initialize wallet from scratch In the pop-up that opens, you must enter a wallet password. The mnemonic password is optional. After you click send, the wallet will return a mnemonic sentence as shown below. You must copy this sentence and save it in a safe place. This sentence will be needed to restore the wallet on a different computer. Restore wallet from earlier Copy the mnemonic sentence from earlier paste it into the \"Mnemonic\" field in the Restore-wallet form. Enter a secure wallet password. Leave the Mnemonic password empty (it is only for advanced users). Refer to the figure below. After the wallet has been successfully restored from the mnemonic sentence, you will see a confirmation as shown in the figure below. Get wallet addresses This is a test to ensure you have set up the node properly. It will return the current addresses in the wallet. In the panel at http://127.0.0.1:9053/panel click on the Wallet tab on the left and then on Get all wallet addresses to view the addresses currently maintained by the wallet. It should return at least one address if the node is set correctly. Check if the node is synced While the node is syncing, the panel will show \"Active synchronization\" (see the image below). After the node is fully synced, the text will change to \"Node is synced\", as shown below. Check wallet balance Once the node is synced, use the wallet API in the panel to see your balance, as shown below. Sending funds If there is a non-zero balance, you can send Ergs to any other address using the panel as shown below: View the Swagger UI A Swagger UI is available at http://127.0.0.1:9053/swagger . You had already used it earlier to compute the hash of your secret. You can also use this UI to make API calls for advanced operations that are not (yet) available in the panel. Some examples of this are: Creating non-standard transactions with registers and context variables. Creating transactions that issue tokens. Creating transactions that use certain boxes as inputs. A future article will discuss each of these operations in detail. Note that most methods in the API are protected and you would need to use your secret (from earlier) to access these methods.

A lot of folks launched a node and also a miner, with pubkeyHex from the miner embedded in the node config. Now information on how to recognize the coins mined and withdraw them to another address. On keys. A miner can see a lot of keys in different formats. First, mining software and also mining support in the node (namely, ergo.node.miningPubKeyHex setting in the config) are using a Base16-encoded \"raw\" public key, which is just an encoded serialized point on elliptic curve. This key is enough for a miner (which can avoid then supporting Base58, address forming etc). Second, a node wallet shows Pay-To-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses, which are starting with \"9\". P2PK adress contains not just elliptic curve point, but also network prefix and checksum , similarly to Bitcoin P2PK and P2PKH addresses. Third, there is minig/rewardAddress API method, which is intended for external tools generating block candidates. This API method shows something like 88dhgzEuTXaSfKEbxfa6vghvEGdBH39sn9h7As2Y2Z6SGd8bKXCXmRLY5JtU4g4RYBP4WcZWb3JwjXDK , which is a special script to pay a miner in encoded form. Anyway, if you put pubkeyHex from you miner into your node, everything is okay, just don't worry about different keys seen. Getting you balance shown & withdrawals Probably you don't see mined coins after wallet initialization, if its done on height after blocks mined. Please note, the node is not scanning blocks backwards, it is only scanning new blocks after the initialization. Thus in order to find mined coins, full blockchain rescan is needed atm (or, if you mine, launch another node on another machine, or on the same machine with different ports set in the config, namely, set new values to scorex.restApi.bindAddress and scorex.network.bindAddress fields; also please use version 3.0.1 as it is easier to configurate). In order to spend rewards you need to follow the steps below: 1. Clear node state, if you're going to stop working node. In order to clear the state of your node you need to stop the node and then remove all contents of .ergo directory (it could be hidden from you on Mac and Linux, try ls -a command in the directory you ran the node from). 2. Restoring a local wallet from the seed-phrase used in the Autolykos miner Remember that mnemonic sentence you set in the config.json when configuring your Autolykos miner - now you need to restore build-in wallet from it. In order to restore your wallet start the node again and send a POST request to http://[your_node_ip]:9053/wallet/restore containing the application/json content-type body like: { \"pass\": \"your_wallet_pass\", \"mnemonic\": \"mnemonic_sentense_from_your_miner\", \"mnemonicPass\": \"mnemonic_pass_if_set\" } , where pass is a new unique pass to be used to encrypt wallet data on your local disk, and mnemonic is a mnemonic phrase you copied from your Autolykos miner config ( config.json ). Please especially pay your attention to mnemonicPass field - this is a password of your mnemonic phrase, it's optional and you could have configured it when generating your mnemonic. So add this field to the request only in case your mnemonic is really protected with a pass, remove this field otherwise. Don't forget to authorize your request setting correct api_key HTTP header corresponding to the apiKeyHash your configured in the node config file. ATTENTION: In order to let the wallet scan all the blocks from the genesis you need to restore the wallet before your node would have started downloading full blocks (Check fullHeight in /info API method response - while it is null your node haven't start downloading full blocks) 3. Check your balance When your node got synced with the network check /wallet/balances API method.

The Proof of Work consensus algorithm and underlying UTxO model enable robust scalability and security. Use Cases of Ergo Oracles: Oracles are the messengers in and out of blockchains. They contain valuable data (e.g. price feed) so that applications work seamlessly. Ergo Blockchain\u2019s design allows Oracle Pools , and this would help to create data hierarchies. A system of oracles that can be scored regarding their trust level is a significant phenomenon. Chainlink\u2019s oracles aren\u2019t capable of forming oracle pools because it\u2019s built on the Ethereum network. Yet Chainlink recently published a whitepaper about decentralized computational networks interacting with blockchains, an idea that Ergo already working on with oracle pools. NIPoPoWs : Non-interactive proofs of proof of works can be used to build an interoperable blockchain ecosystem. With NIPoPoW implementation, Ergo Blockchain can interact with the smart contracts on proof of stake networks. This would open up an integrated use case between different dApps on different blockchains. Cardano is already planning to implement side chains with NIPoPoWs in collaboration with EMURGO. Limits are yet to be discovered. Multi-Sig: Multi-Sig or Multi Provers are helpful for the reliability of smart contracts. This kind of implementation is vital for security. So that smart contracts aren\u2019t in control of one person, but rather governed by multiple accounts. Multi-stage contracts can also be designed for punishing malicious actors trying to take control of smart contracts. Time Epoch: Ergo Blockchain can be designed to have timed operations. For example, during an ICO (or IDO ), a code in a smart contract can provide timed release so that investors have a protective layer if the project owner isn\u2019t delivering his/her promises. In Ethereum, programming such a kind of timed operation isn\u2019t possible. Parachain/Sidechains: This is a yet-to-develop area for Ergo Blockchain. It\u2019s certainly possible, and we know that the implementation of parachains has a significant impact on scalability. Our core developer Alex Chepurnoy is about to release a paper on it, so stay tuned! Stablecoins Blockchain assets can be extremely volatile. That\u2019s why investors often seek digital assets which are pegged to national currencies. A Stablecoin is the most primitive integration of cryptocurrencies with the off-chain world. Until DAI, fiat custody services were provided by centralized services. The first example of a stable coin, USDT, is backed by actual dollars held in banks. However, for a decentralized financial system, we need other means of fiat-pegged currencies. Launched in February, Ergo\u2019s native stablecoin SigUSD is based on AgeUSD protocol to provide a robust Reserve/Mint contract. Providing a truly decentralized finance experience. It\u2019s collateralized with its own native cryptocurrency reserves ERG using SigRSV as the trust component which gives SigUSD\u2019s $1 value. SigRSV collateral ratio is set to a minimum of a 400% ratio with SigUSD. This design prohibits liquidations such as we saw in 2020 March crash . As Emurgo states, \"Black Thursday,\" when MakerDAO CDPs were triggered for liquidation due to volatility and then sold for $0 due to blockchain congestion that prevented others from bidding, demonstrated that a new design is needed. For SigmaUSD, this scenario is not possible. Oracles Oracles are the backbone of a decentralized financial system. It connects off-chain data with the on-chain world. Normally, ETH has no info about the current market price. During a swap order in a decentralized exchange, a swap contract needs to call the data from various data sources to obtain market price. Thus, oracles are the messengers of the crypto ecosystem. Not only in atomic swaps but also in more complex interactions such as lending/borrowing assets or dynamic market-making need the data feeds provided by oracles. DeFi ecosystem suffered from Flash Loan attacks, caused by misinformation from centralized price oracles . Ergo developed Oracle Pools to maintain a robust DeFi ecosystem. Because of the eUTXO design and its rich programming language ErgoScript, oracle networks can be more decentralized. In the extended UTXO model, we have a lot of flexibility and power available to build new protocols. This can be utilized to construct oracle datapoint hierarchies of confidence. In short, they are an abstraction above oracle pools which allows us to scale the benefits of oracle pools as much as we desire, at the cost of price and speed. ERG/USD oracle pool is running on Ergo Blockchain. Shrimpcoin - The first shrimp-pinned stablecoin on Ergo NFT Blockchains aren\u2019t only about cryptocurrencies. Audio or visual artworks can also be deployed on immutable smart contracts of blockchains. These artworks are represented by Non-Fungible Tokens . Furthermore, artworks can be traded in decentralized auction houses. This would help artists to reach the world without any restriction of governments or without any need for centralized licensing firms. It means the democratization of art markets with the help of public blockchain. Some examples like Rarible or Opensea are auction markets running on Ethereum Network. Any artist can create and sell their artwork in there, however, gas prices to mint an NFT can take up to $100. Ergo\u2019s scalable and faster design would reduce the gas costs to almost zero, without giving up security or speed. Ergo NFT Auctionhouse is open for months and it allows listings for a picture, audio, or any other kind of non-fungible tokens. DEX Until 2020 DeFi Summer, Value Locked in DeFi ( TVL ) was too low to use the platforms effectively. After an increasing interest and new token issuance every day, Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) came into the sunlight. Their benefits are for people who don\u2019t want to give up the custody of their funds. DEXes democratized the exchange experience for both blockchain developers and crypto investors. ErgoDEX can provide more functions than Ethereum based DEXes. ErgoDEX has more properties such as limit orders, partial filling, and buy-back supports. Ergo\u2019s Multi-Stage Contracts allows for timed release payments, so a code implemented in the contract can help investors to cancel their order with a minimal loss if the developers of the project don\u2019t deliver their promises. With the implementation of NIPoPoWS, DEX will be interoperable in both PoS and PoW blockchains. Users can enjoy the freedom of exchanges with self-custodial wallets. DAO DAO stands for Decentral Autonomous Organizations . Cryptocurrencies are decentralized (not all of them!), and so their platforms. The governance of these platforms is run by decentralized entities. Every decision is made by pseudo-anonym individuals of DeFi platforms for prohibiting the centralization of power. Therefore, certain tokens are used for voting or making enhancements to these DeFi platforms. New coin issuances , redefinition of purposes etc. are all very vital features and can\u2019t be left to a small group of individuals if the crypto ecosystem is for the masses. Zero-Knowledge Treasury Vaults with multi-key signature are the first example of a DAO in Ergo Blockchain. Lending - Borrowing Lending and borrowing are two components that increase liquidity flow in financial systems. For example, you have Bitcoins but you want to leverage your holding without selling your BTC. So, you can stake your BTC (you can also use your house as collateral in this sense) as collateral to borrow SigUSD and use it in exchanges or yield farming protocols. On the other side of your interaction, another user can leverage her unused SigUSD by staking in the lending protocol. Traditional banks have very low-interest rates and they might suck up a lot of revenue from your deposits. With decentral lending protocols such as Compound , users will be able to use lend/borrow services and move their funds across all crypto ecosystems without any need for centralized platforms such as banks or exchanges. Crypto lending protocols are open to more experimental designs such as interest-free loans , innovating even more use cases on blockchains. Derivatives Besides buying and selling the tokens of a protocol, traders also want to monetize via various strategies such as options or leveraged future contracts. In traditional finance, these tools are provided by brokerage firms and in the crypto world by centralized exchanges. However, this can turn out to be very harmful towards traders by making exchanges big casinos who can see the player\u2019s hands. That\u2019s why in decentralized finance, there is also an alternative as options or derivatives trading smart contract platform. Synthetix is an example of leveraged assets trading platform. The platform token creates liquidity for the traders who want to take leveraged positions. Hegic on the other hand provides an options trading platform for traders who wants to bet on call-put options via smart contracts. These are just two examples of derivatives protocols on Ethereum. Ergo Blockchain\u2019s Multi-Stage Contracts can also provide these protocols on top of it. Insurance Another big sector of the finance industry is Insurance. Every exchangeable asset carries a risk of losing it, whether by unprecedented risks such as taking a bullet to your Ledger Wallet or foreseeable risks such as rug pulls . New protocols emerged such as Nexus Mutual to tackle the decentral insurance problem. If you think about insurance, it pays a premium to risk bearers in case a bad event happens, exchanging your money for security. In a Decentralized Insurance platform: Your participation, risk bearers\u2019 participation and validation of the trade by oracles can all be governed by smart contracts to create a smoothly functioning DeFi ecosystem. Yield Aggregation So after an expansion of new decentralized exchanges such as Bancor , Balancer , Uniswap , Sushiswap , and Curve , people are started to look for easier ways to move capital around those exchanges to create the best yields. Yield Aggregators are helping users to automate the liquidity farming actions. The first example of a yield aggregation protocol is Yearn Finance . In the protocol, users can choose different yield farming strategies among the vaults deployed. Not only users but also developers can leverage yield farming platforms by creating their unique yield farming strategies and deploying them on protocols. Such examples will be very useful for market-making algorithms in the future by supporting deep liquidity all across DeFi. Bonds based on Ergo (or the \u201cYield protocol\u201d) Index Coins Not all crypto investors are conscient about different blockchain use cases. Some of the investors may want to benefit from indexed tokens to invest in various cryptocurrencies. For such an innovation dynamic market-making(DMM) algorithms would be necessary to adjust the funds after price changes. Besides, people who will release index tokens must have the market knowledge to decide which tokens must be involved in the indexed and for how many percentage. Some examples of index coins running on Ethereum are ASSY, YETI, PIPT, YLA issued by Powerpool Protocol . Asset Tokenization Asset Tokenization is meeting traditional financial assets with crypto. A centralized exchange FTX provides US stocks in exchange for cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon, however, is very new due to regulation problems. Stock tokens are not yet traded on decentralized exchanges. Another example of tokenization of real-world assets would be real estate tokenization. With the help of cryptocurrencies, houses can be fractionated into thousands of tokens representing real estate. These kinds of implementations will help retail investors to invest in houses all around the world with minimal savings. All the utilities of traditional banks are becoming decentralized applications on smart contract platforms. Ergo is providing robust and rich infrastructure with ErgoScript language to support a complex DeFi ecosystem powered by Multi-Stage Contracts .

Previously there were partial or complete shutdowns in Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan, Turkey. However, people have right to store value available, whether the value is under threat from monetary policies, political instability, or war. Happily, with digital communications and digital gold this problem could be solved. As possible solution for Bitcoin, Blockstream satellite network could be used, however, satellite signal could be jammed. Another workaround which I am going to propose is to use e-mail (which is last to be blocked usually) or other low-bandwidth and not very interactive means of communication (fax, modem call over a landline to a bulletin board system, mail).

This will just be another option along with @mhs_sam's pool. I thought I would post my collateral box script here for public review, in case I've missed any obvious issues: { val poolReward = 67500000000L { // Case 1: block was mined by alice. // Either: (a) we have 1 output of value poolReward, // or: (b) we have 2 outputs, 1st is poolReward, 2nd goes to self. decodePoint(CONTEXT.minerPubKey) == alice && HEIGHT > SELF.creationInfo._1 && OUTPUTS(0).value == poolReward && { OUTPUTS.size == 1 || { OUTPUTS.size == 2 && OUTPUTS(1).propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes && OUTPUTS(1).creationInfo._1 == HEIGHT } } } || { // Case 2: anyone can top-up with more collateral funds.

The main limitation of this approach is that only one unspent collateral box should exist at any time for a given miner public key, otherwise a pool can spend more than one box in the same block and claim a multiple of the reward. However, I think this is reasonable and it becomes too complex if miners have to create special signatures to avoid this. The top-up mechanism (case 2) allows anyone to top-up a given collateral box. Another small point is that the pool reward could be adjusted to be a bit under 67.5 ERG to provide additional incentives, though I would note that the miner already gets to keep all the fees if they mine a block.

Full discussion here","title":"Collateral Mining"},{"location":"uses/context-claims/","text":"Recently I have been working through designing various DeFi protocols in the Ergo contract model, and the thought came to mind that to make things more efficient it would be of great benefit if we could make claims about the global state of the blockchain/UTXO-set. This lead me to come up with the concept of global context data accumulation (which I will explain in a moment) however I didn't realize that the concept is even further extendable to any claim about the blockchain state until a conversation with @jasondavies and @scalahub where they pointed out negative proofs are possible. So, what are these \"Efficient Global Context Claims\" then? In essence, smart contract enabled blockchains to date have various levels of context available to developers in the smart contracts themselves. Some may allow little to no outside data from other accounts/utxos/contracts, while others like Ethereum only allow smart contracts to specifically call one anothers' functions to return a value and obtain that tiny slice of context that way. What all of these systems/models lack is the ability to make claims about the state of every single account/UTXO/smart contract on the entire system. There are clear reasons for this, it is horribly inefficient. With blockchains like Ethereum where it's almost impossible for a user to bootstrap a full node, expecting a validator to go through the entire state of the blockchain to validate a logical check in a single contract is impossible to even consider implementing when they're already constantly hitting limits. Ergo on the other hand is the only blockchain out there which has smart contracts on a UTXO-based system and has the concept of data-inputs. For those who are not familiar, data-inputs allow you to reference a UTXO/box in a transaction without spending it. Thus you have access to all of the data/value of tokens within a UTXO without needing to have the right to spend it. Following that line of reasoning, this means we can check data from any dApp/contract on the blockchain without needing permission or having to encode anything at all in the contract to support doing so. This has major implications which we will now get into. Because data-inputs allow anyone to reference the registers and tokens of any box, this means that we can make generic claims about the whole system and have any user on the system prove/disprove said claims. For example we can arbitrarily create a smart contract that specifies This UTXO can only be spent if another UTXO exists with the number 5 in Register R4 and it holds 5 Erg . If such a box exists with 5 Erg and the number 5 in register R4, then anyone can create a transaction using said box as a data-input, thereby proving that such a box exists and giving them the right to spend the UTXO. Now, what if we were to include a reward (say 100 Ergs) together with our smart contract which is making a claim about the global context? This would provide a monetary incentive for actors (who are not the validators) to scan the entire UTXO-set to find a box that proves the claim at hand, thereby earning the actor money. Thus we could create a box which holds 100 Ergs and specifies the following claim in it's smart contract: This UTXO can only be spent if a box exists which holds at least 1000 Ergs at the smart contract address \"2iHkR7CWvD1R4j1yZg5bke...\" . If such a box exists, then anyone can cite the box as a data-input and earn the 100 Ergs. This is a trivial task, and would earn someone about $20.00 USD (in today's Erg/USD conversion rate). Thus, if our smart contract box does not get spent over the course of the proceeding blocks, we come to the conclusion that such a box does not exist on the network. Thus we have outsourced the scanning and verifying of the global state of the blockchain to users who have a monetary incentive, while making it seamless and trustless due to using data-inputs. Now, if we implement software to streamline this task automatically and make it trivial for Ergo users to run at a profit, we can gain a high level of assurance about the claims we make on-chain (the greater the reward the greater the incentive for \"verifiers\" to make sure that the claim does/does not hold thereby increasing the assurance). One can view this as an efficient and trustless (due to data-inputs providing proof of validity) variation of oracles where each oracle only processes data from the blockchain and folds it down into a boolean result. This should be possible to run on commodity hardware by anyone anywhere in the world with an internet connection and computer, allowing for a truly decentralized system of \"verifiers\" who make it possible to make efficient global context claims about the entire blockchain. This also acts as a superb way for users to come into the ecosystem and earn Erg while providing a truly pivotal service with a low barrier of entry. Once the utxo-set grows very large and the claims become more complex, we could even imagine \"verification pools\" coming about, where users are given a segment of the UTXO-set to keep track of/process and receive a small portion of any rewards that their \"verification pool\" wins. This opens up a lot of doors of opportunity. With what I've outlined above, we have the ability to make any claim at all, about any token or piece of data in any register that is part of any dApp on the entire blockchain. Very powerful. However, we can do even more which I alluded to in the beginning. Global Context Data Accumulators Since data-inputs provide us with full context of a given UTXO, it means that we can also apply arbitrary functions to said data instead of just boolean checks. Thus, we can have our simple \"verifiers\" actually become \"accumulators\" who scan the entire blockchain to find all relevant boxes, and then fold the data down into a single/set of values which get posted into a new single box. For example, let's say we want to know the total number of Erg which are held in a smart contract at the address of 2iHkR7CWvD1R4j1yZg5bke . We can post a box with a 100 Erg reward on-chain with a contract that specifies anyone can spend the box if: 1. The user provides at least 1 data-input of a box owned by 2iHkR7CWvD1R4j1yZg5bke . 2. The user creates a single new box with: - The number of data-inputs he provided in register R4 - The accumulated data in R5 (total number of Ergs held in all data-inputs) - His public key in register R6 - This box locked under the \"Finalizing Accumulation\" script This new box under the \"Finalizing Accumulation\" script finalizes/ends the accumulation if no one spends it in the next 5 blocks. However it allows anyone to spend the box if they: 1. Provide at least 1 more data-input than the value in register R4. 2. Create a single new box with: - The number of data-inputs he provided in register R4 - The accumulated data in R5 (total number of Ergs held in all data-inputs) - His public key in register R6 - This box locked under the \"Finalizing Accumulation\" script again Thus, the user has proven that he/she has found more data-inputs than the previous user which match the stated restrictions. Once the accumulation has finalized because no one has spent it after 5 blocks, the user who has their address in R6 can withdraw his reward and move the value in R5 (the accumulated datapoint) into a new box of it's own in a register allowing anyone on the entire network to easily reference it as a data-input. Admittedly this is a slightly naive way to implement an accumulator scheme (as it could take arbitrarily long for the datapoint to finalize, and probably could use an NFT to make it easy to find the finalized datapoint for example), but it was chosen to be as clear as possible for how accumulators could be implemented/work. We can likely build out \"data accumulation pools\" where there are hard-capped time limits for protocols that require consistent data accumulation. Context data accumulators allow us to sum up the state of the blockchain into one or more registers of a new box. This can be very useful in many use cases such as in DeFi where you may need to know the total funds held in a liquidity pool contract in order to calculate interest rates accurately. Using context data accumulators to checkpoint/accumulate the state of the blockchain allows users to parallelize actions within dApps inside of their own UTXOs completely separate from others, while still contributing to a global shared core state of the dApp that is put together by the accumulators. It may even be possible to one day merge such schemes with sharding and/or side-chains to allow for scaling of smart contracts thanks to the nature of the UTXO model and this snapshot/accumulation approach to contract design. Conclusion With all of that said, thanks to Ergo's UTXO model with data-inputs, we have the ability to trustlessly fold the whole UTXO-set state down into a single value and post the result on-chain. By leveraging monetary incentives, we can thus use this to create efficient claims on global blockchain context and/or accumulate data into a single box that is readable by anyone and everyone. There is likely a lot more to be said/thought about with all of this, but I believe this should be good enough of a starting point to get the idea out there in an understandable form. Update Here are some further of my thoughts from Discord on improving security for claims using pools (Which is also possible for data accumulation which further allows for accumulating/check pointing in predefined time intervals.): For claims, we can probably separate time into epochs/intervals as well, and anyone who joins a \"Claim Pool\" for a specific claim has to put up some collateral on entry which shows that they are actively checking said claim. Whoever first posts the counter-proof to the claim gets the reward (or maybe we can use a 1st (65%) 2nd (25%) 3rd (10%) payout scheme). However all other participants must also post the counter-claim as well within a given time duration to prove their active participation. If one participant fails to do so then it shows that they have failed to perform their task, and therefore their collateral is given to all of the other active participants in equal portions. We could even incorporate residual-payout schemes with such Claim pools, where there is a large reward for proving the counterclaim, however verifiers still receive a reward in every epoch if no counter-proof is produced by any participant. This way you incentivize active checking for a long duration of time while still providing enough funds for verifiers to continue. (Though we'd need the per-epoch fee to be several orders of magnitude smaller than the reward so that game theoretically it is always in everyone's best interest to claim the reward rather than all participants colluding and just getting passive rewards for doing nothing). To make this even more robust, we could theoretically also add the ability for outsiders to provide counter-proofs to the claim after an epoch has finished in the proceeding epoch. Thus if the pool participants colluded to not provide the counter-proof data-input and someone else can prove that the claim has been disproved via a data-input, then said outsider can redeem the reward and all of the collateral of all pool participants. As such pool participants receive a small residual-income for actively checking, and if they fail to do their job then outsiders have an incentive to double-check in order to receive the reward and \"liquidate\" all of the pool participants' collateral. Going further, we could also encode arbitrary entry conditions for joining a Claim Pool. It could just be submitting collateral and redeeming a \"pool entry token\" allowing for seamless entry/exit, could be semi-permissioned, and/or there could be hard-caps to the total number of verifiers (could be useful if residual payout scheme is in place). There's a lot of flexibility with all of this, and I think it should be possible to create some sort of a go-to default scheme which provides solid security together with good incentives for active claim checking. After some more thinking I've realized that with global context claims we can also easily create trustless prediction markets for the state of any dApp/contract/data on-chain. Essentially you could just mint 2 different tokens and lock them in a contract that has a claim in it. People can buy a \"True\" token or a \"False\" token, and if the claim gets proven before an expiration block height then say \"True\" token holders get paid out, else if the block height arrives then the \"False\" holders get paid out. The claim can be proven by anyone via a data-input, and so we could just have a basic prize, or a full fledged claim pool to make it secure.","title":"Context claims"},{"location":"uses/context-claims/#global-context-data-accumulators","text":"Since data-inputs provide us with full context of a given UTXO, it means that we can also apply arbitrary functions to said data instead of just boolean checks.

The need to reform the global financial system has been evident since the last crisis in 2008. Now, COVID-19 has forced our hands. We cannot delay, and the best way to start is from the grassroots. Cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich ordinary people. Their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital. This is what inspired me. This is my dream. The Ergo Manifesto A Local Exchange Trading System A local exchange trading system (LETS) is a local mutual credit association which members are allowed to create common credit money individually, with all the deals in the system written into a common ledger. As an example, assume that Alice with zero balance is willing to buy a liter of raw milk from Bob. First, they agree on a price, for example, assume that the price is about 2 Euro (as Alice and Bob are living in Ireland). After the deal being written into a ledger, Alice's balance becomes -2 (minus two) Euro, and Bob's balance becomes 2 Euro. Then Bob may spend his 2 Euro, for example, on home-made beer from Charlie. Often, such systems impose limits on negative balances, and sometimes even on positive ones, in order to promote exchange in the community. Historically, such systems become popular during crisis times. The first system was established by Michael Linton in a Canadian town stuck in depression back in 1981. Local exchange trading systems were extremely popular during 1998-2002 Argentine Great Depression. Most LETS groups range from 50 to 250 members, with paper-based credit notes and ledger maintained by a core committee. However, paper-based LETS currencies have shown some problems, such as counterfeit notes, possible rogue behavior of system managers, and so on. Therefore, blockchain-based LETS could be superior to the old systems. More information on LETS could be found in \"The Ecology of Money\" book (by Richard Douthwaite) and Wikipedia . In this article we show how LETS could be implemented on top of Ergo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of such kind of community currency on top of a blockchain. Our reference implementation is simple and consists of two contracts, namely, a management contract and an exchange contract. We skip Ergo preliminaries, so please read the ICO article and ErgoScript tutorials( basic and advanced ) for starters. Nevertheless, we are going to introduce a couple of new terms in following sentences. If a token is issued with amount equal to one, we call it the singleton token. Similarly, a box which contains the singleton token is called the singleton box. The management contract is controlling a singleton box which holds members of the LETS system. The contract enables the adding of new members at the pace of one member per one transaction. The box is not storing members, but only a small digest of authenticated data structure built on top of the members' directory. A member is associated with a singleton token issued in a transaction which is adding the member to the directory. The transaction creates a new member's box which contains the member's singleton token. The member's box is protected by the exchange contract. Also, the newly created member's box has initial balance written down into the R4 register, and the balance is equal to zero in our example. The transaction creating a new member must provide a proof of correctness for directory transformation. The management contract box is controlled usually by a committee, and the committee could evolve over time. To support that, we allow committee logic to reside in the register R5. For example, assume that a new committee member has been added along with a new LETS member, the input management contract box is requiring 2-out-of-3 signatures, and the output box requires 3-out-of-4 signatures. In this case contents of the R5 register in the input and the output box would differ. The management contract code in ErgoScript with comments is provided below. Please note that \"userContractHash\" is about exchange contract hash. val selfOut = OUTPUTS(0) // Management script val managementScript = selfOut.R5[SigmaProp].get // The management script template is replicating self, and management script is satisfied val scriptCorrect = (selfOut.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes) && managementScript // A spending transaction is creating boxes for directory, user, fee. val outsSizeCorrect = OUTPUTS.size == 3 // Checks that the management label token is replicating self val outTokenCorrect = (selfOut.tokens.size == 1) && (selfOut.tokens(0)._1 == letsToken) // Checks that new token is issued, and its amount is correct // OUTPUTS(0) tokens already checked via outtokenCorrect val issuedTokenId = INPUTS(0).id val userOut = OUTPUTS(1) val correctTokenAmounts = (userOut.tokens.size == 1 && userOut.tokens(0)._1 == issuedTokenId && userOut.tokens(0)._2 == 1 && OUTPUTS(2).tokens.size == 0 && outTokenCorrect) // Checks that the new user has been created with the zero balance val zeroUserBalance = userOut.R4[Long].get == 0 val properUserScript = blake2b256(userOut.propositionBytes) == userContractHash // Checks that the new token identifier has been added to the directory val selfTree = SELF.R4[AvlTree].get val toAdd: Coll[(Coll[Byte], Coll[Byte])] = Coll((issuedTokenId, Coll[Byte]())) val proof = getVar[Coll[Byte]](1).get val modifiedTree = selfTree.insert(toAdd, proof).get val expectedTree = selfOut.R4[AvlTree].get val treeCorrect = modifiedTree == expectedTree correctTokenAmounts && scriptCorrect && treeCorrect && zeroUserBalance && properUserScript correctTokenAmounts && scriptCorrect && treeCorrect && zeroUserBalance && properUserScript correctTokenAmounts && scriptCorrect && treeCorrect && zeroUserBalance && properUserScript The exchange contract script is fairly straightforward and provided below along with comments describing its logic. In the contract, it is assumed that a spending transaction for an exchange contract box is receiving at least two inputs, and the first two inputs should be protected by the exchange contract script and contain LETS member tokens. To check that singleton member tokens in the inputs do indeed belong to the LETS system, a spending transaction provides the management contract box as the first read-only data input, and also should provide a proof that the member tokens do belong to the directory authenticated via the R4 register of the management contract box. \"letsToken\" in the script is about the singleton token of the management box. // Minimal balance allowed for LETS trader val minBalance = -20000 val lookupProof = getVar[Coll[Byte]](1).get // The read-only box which contains directory of LETS members val treeHolderBox = CONTEXT.dataInputs(0) val properLetsToken = treeHolderBox.tokens(0)._1 == letsToken val membersTree = treeHolderBox.R4[AvlTree].get // A spending transaction is taking two boxes of LETS members willing to make a deal, // and returns boxes with modified balances. val participant0 = INPUTS(0) val participant1 = INPUTS(1) val participantOut0 = OUTPUTS(0) val participantOut1 = OUTPUTS(1) //Check that members do indeed belong to the LETS val token0 = participant0.tokens(0)._1 val token1 = participant1.tokens(0)._1 val memberTokens = Coll(token0, token1) val membersExist = membersTree.getMany(memberTokens, lookupProof).forall({ (o: Option[Coll[Byte]]) => o.isDefined }) // Check that LETS member balance changes during the deal are correct val initialBalance0 = participant0.R4[Long].get val initialBalance1 = participant1.R4[Long].get val finishBalance0 = participantOut0.R4[Long].get val finishBalance1 = participantOut1.R4[Long].get val diff0 = finishBalance0 - initialBalance0 val diff1 = finishBalance1 - initialBalance1 val diffCorrect = diff0 == -diff1 val balancesCorrect = (finishBalance0 > minBalance) && (finishBalance1 > minBalance) && diffCorrect // Check that member boxes save their scripts. // todo: optimization could be made here val script0Saved = participantOut0.propositionBytes == participant0.propositionBytes val script1Saved = participantOut1.propositionBytes == participant1.propositionBytes val scriptsSaved = script0Saved && script1Saved // Member-specific box protection val selfPubKey = SELF.R5[SigmaProp].get selfPubKey && properLetsToken && membersExist && diffCorrect && scriptsSaved Note that both contracts could be modified in many ways to get new systems with different properties. So hopefully some day this article will be continued! A Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) is aimed at developing local economy and is usually used by people of a locality in the vicinity of each other. For a brief overview of LETS see this link , which also describes an ErgoScript implementation of a committee managed LETS. We call such a system a managed or permissioned , since it depends on a committee of trusted members to enroll new members into the LETS. Here we describe a trustless LETS, i.e., one where there is no management committee needed for enrolment. Overview LETS involves several parties that agree to use some form of \"local currency\", usually pegged to the country's main currency at a 1:1 rate. Assume that our LETS is based in a European country where the currency is Euros, and the exchange is done in \"local Euros\", which are considered to be equivalent to national Euros. Each user in LETS has an account, which contains the LETS balance of that user (in Local Euros). On joining, each user has a balance of zero. The balance is stored in a (possibly decentralized) ledger. An interesting feature of LETS is that a user with zero balance can also \"withdraw\" money, but only for paying another LETS user. At any time the sum of LETS balances of all the users is zero. As an example, Alice with zero balance wishes to purchase one liter of milk for 2 Euros from Bob who is also a member of LETS with zero balance. She transfers 2 Euros from her account to Bob's, making her balance -2 and Bob's +2. Bob can then transfer some or all of his balance to another LETS user in exchange for goods or services. Trustless LETS Since we desire a trustless LETS, we cannot depend on any trusted group of people to admit users. Note that we will still have a committee to perform some tasks such as setting up the LETS parameters (local currency, the maximum number of members, etc) and consuming any joining fee. We will only assume a trusted pricing oracle that gives the current rate of euros to ergs identified by some global id ( rateTokenID ) and a singleton box containing exactly one token with this id. A singleton box, described here , is a box containing a singleton token , i.e., a token with only one quantity in existence. This box also contains the rate of ergs to euros at any given period of time. The rate is updated by spending this box and creating another singleton box with the new rate. At any instance, our LETS is uniquely defined by a global token box that contains some membership tokens with id letsTokenID . This box defines the LETS parameters such as the location, the currency unit, rateTokenID , etc. The token box is initially started with, say, 10000 membership tokens. Users can spend this box and create their individual LETS boxes as outputs of the transaction, such that each such output has exactly one membership token and the balance membership tokens are put in a newly created token box. A LETS box represents a LETS member and must be used in every transaction. For simplicity, this article restricts all LETS transaction to involve exactly two members, one being the sender and the other the receiver, such that the sender transfers some positive amount of the LETS currency (local euros) to the receiver. Such a transaction consumes the member's boxes and recreates them as output with the updated balance. The Basic Variant To prevent spam and DDoS attacks, we require at least some minimum number of ergs ( minErgsToJoin ) to be locked in the newly created member's box. The ergs will be locked until at least minWithdrawTime number of blocks have been mined. A box is allowed to have a negative LETS balance upto the amount that can be covered by the locked ergs (using the rate at the time of trade). // a tokenBox stores the membership tokens and has this script val tokenBox = OUTPUTS(0) // the first output must also be a tokenBox // first output contains remaining LETS tokens def isLets(b:Box) = { // returns true if b is a LETS box // A LETS box must have exactly 1 membership token in tokens(0) b.tokens(0)._1 == letsTokenID && b.tokens(0)._2 == 1 && blake2b256(b.propositionBytes) == memberBoxScriptHash && SELF.R4[Long].get == 0 && // start the box with zero LETS balance b.value >= minErgsToJoin && // the box must contain some minimum ergs b.R6[Long].get <= HEIGHT // store the creation height in R6 } // how many lets boxes creared in the tx val numLetsBoxes = OUTPUTS.filter({(b:Box) => isLets(b)}).size // In the transaction following is preserved for the token box ... tokenBox.tokens(0)._1 == SELF.tokens(0)._1 && // token id tokenBox.tokens(0)._2 == SELF.tokens(0)._2 - numLetsBoxes && // quantity tokenBox.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes // script A LETS member's box is protected by the script below, whose hash memberBoxScriptHash is used above. The script requires exactly one (sender, receiver) pair per transaction. val validRateOracle = CONTEXT.dataInputs(0).tokens(0)._1 == rateTokenID val rate = CONTEXT.dataInputs(0).R4[Int].get val inBalance = SELF.R4[Long].get // LETS balance of current input val pubKey = SELF.R5[SigmaProp].get // owner of the current input val createdAt = SELF.R6[Long].get // height at which current input was mined val index = getVar[Int](0).get // index of the corresponding output val out = OUTPUTS(index) val outBalance = out.R4[Long].get // LETS balance of the output // A LETS box is one that has the same script as the current box val isMemberBox = {(b:Box) => b.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes} val letsInputs = INPUTS.filter(isMemberBox) // all LETS input boxes val letsOutputs = OUTPUTS.filter(isMemberBox) // all LETS output boxes // The current input belongs to the receiver if its LETS balance increases // There may be some ergs in receiver's input box. We need to ensure that // the receiver's output box also contains the same amount of ergs as input val receiver = outBalance > inBalance && out.value == SELF.value val getBalance = {(b:Box) => b.R4[Long].get} // returns LETS balance of a box val letsBalIn = letsInputs.map(getBalance).fold(0L, {(l:Long, r:Long) => l + r}) val letsBalOut = letsOutputs.map(getBalance).fold(0L, {(l:Long, r:Long) => l + r}) // sender box can contain less amount of ergs (sender may withdraw ergs provided // that any negative LETS balance of sender in out is backed by sufficient ergs) val correctErgs = out.value >= -outBalance * rate && ( out.value >= SELF.value || SELF.R6[Long].get + minWithdrawTime > HEIGHT ) // for the receiver, we don't touch the erg balance, // since a receiver is not actively involved in the transaction inBalance != outBalance && // some transaction should occur; balance must change SELF.tokens(0)._1 == letsTokenID && // the current input has the right token out.tokens(0)._1 == letsTokenID && // corresponding output has the right token validRateOracle && // oracle providing rate has the correct \"rate token\" letsBalIn == letsBalOut && // total LETS balance is preserved in the transaction letsInputs.size == 2 && letsOutputs.size == 2 && // only two LETS inputs, outputs out.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes && // out is a LETS box ... out.R5[SigmaProp].get == pubKey && // ... with the right pub key out.R6[Long].get == SELF.R6[Long].get && // ... and creation height (receiver || // either current input belongs to receiver ... (pubKey && correctErgs) // ... or out has correct ergs and tx has signature ) The transaction spending a box with the above script requires: - The sum of the LETS balance of inputs and outputs is preserved - There are two LETS inputs and two LETS outputs - The public keys (stored in R5) is preserved in the corresponding output - The creation height (stored in R6) be preserved in the corresponding output We say that some public key is the receiver if the LETS balance of its output is higher than that of its input. The last condition requires that either the input and output boxes belong to the receiver (so that the ergs are preserved), or, in case they belong to the sender, a signature is provided and the output is backed by the required number of ergs if its LETS balance is negative. Furthermore, it requires that the sender's ergs balance cannot be reduced until at least minWithdrawTime number of blocks have been mined after the ergs were locked. Compared to the managed LETS, the above system has the following differences: No membership record : Unlike the managed LETS, We don't store any membership information here. Multiple-boxes : A person can create multiple membership boxes, which is permitted. We only require that any negative balance be backed by the corresponding number of ergs locked in it. LETS-1: Zero Sum, Collateral The above is the basic variant, which we call LETS-1 . It has the following features: Time-locked Joining-Fee : To prevent spam attacks, a member has to pay a certain minimum fee in ergs at the time of joining. This fee is refundable but only after a predefined number of blocks. Zero Sum : The sum of the LETS balances of all member boxes is zero. Member boxes are allowed to have a negative balance as long as it is within a certain limit. Collateral : For the sender's output, ergs are used as collateral to cover negative LETS balance at the current exchange rate. The following are some variations of LETS-1. LETS-2: Zero Sum, No collateral This is a slight variation of LETS-1 as follows: Non-refundable joining fee : Similar to LETS-1, a joining fee is needed to prevent spam attacks. However, unlike LETS-1, this fee is non-refundable and must be sent to some predefined management committee. Zero Sum : As in LETS-1. LETS-3: Positive-Sum, Collateral The above two variants require the total LETS balance to be always zero. Here we consider a positive value for this sum. In particular, this variant has the following properties: Time-locked Joining Fee : As in LETS-1. Positive Sum : The LETS balance of every member must always be non-negative. This ensures that the sum of the LETS balances of all member boxes is positive. The initial LETS balance is set to a positive value based on the joining fee at the current rate, capped to some maximum value. Collateral : Any reduction in ergs balance of the sender must be accompanied by a reduction of the corresponding LETS balance at the current exchange rate. We can also allow topping up the LETS balance during a transaction by adding the equivalent amount of ergs. LETS-4: Positive-Sum, No collateral This is similar to LETS-3 but with some small variations: Non-refundable Joining Fee : As in LETS-2 Positive-Sum : As in LETS-3 The following table summarizes the variants: Zero Sum Positive Sum Collateral LETS-1 LETS-3 No collateral LETS-2 LETS-4 We considered LETS transactions involving a single sender-receiver pair. More advanced models can allow multiple senders and receivers, and need not be in pairs. The need to reform the global financial system has been clear since the last crisis in 2008. Now, COVID-19 has forced our hands. We cannot delay, and the best way to start is from the grassroots. As lockdowns across the world effectively shut down whole sectors and a large part of the economy, we are entering a new era at breakneck pace. Central banks are taking unprecedented action in the form of money printing but, just like last time around, they will almost certainly fail at the \u2018last mile\u2019 (intentionally or otherwise): while their efforts will benefit the financial sector and the wealthy, the funds will not reach those small businesses and individuals who need them the most. Crossing the last mile Technology like the Ergo platform can address this problem efficiently, building bridges into and within our local economies without the need for commercial or central banks. A key principle of Ergo, and one stated in the white paper, is that it is for regular people. The developers have spent considerable time building technology that can be applied to real-world use cases. (This is the idea behind \u2018 Smart contracts for the people \u2019, for example.) LETS In the present circumstances, a Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) would be a strong use case for Ergo . A LETS is a mutual credit association in which individual members are allowed to borrow from a common pot of money. All the loans are written into a ledger. Naturally, a blockchain system allows for strict and more granular rules around the size of loans and their use, as well as user privacy. For example, let\u2019s assume Alice has a zero balance. She wants to buy a litre of milk from Bob, and borrows the agreed price of 2 euros from the common pot. Alice\u2019s account now registers -2 euros and Bob\u2019s +2 euros. Bob can spend his balance with other participants of the LETS, and the creation of credit allows for economic activity and velocity of money even where people have, temporarily, no cash. Of course, limits on borrowing can be imposed \u2013 and even on positive ones, to prevent hoarding within the LETS. Such a system can be built trustlessly on Ergo . Crisis measures Systems like this have historically become popular during times of crisis. The first system of this kind was established by Michael Linton in a Canadian town stuck in depression back in 1981. LETS were also popular during the 1998-2002 Argentine Great Depression. Most LETS groups consist of 50 to 250 members, with paper-based credit notes and ledgers maintained by a committee. However, it is unsurprising that paper-based LETS have suffered from problems such as counterfeit notes, dishonest activity by administrators, and so on (much like centralised crypto exchanges). A blockchain-based LETS could be vastly superior to any previous system. Moreover, building lots of small credit systems on the same blockchain enables interoperability and novel financial products designed to strengthen the system as a whole. Hundreds of different LETS could exist, for individuals and small businesses, with different participation criteria, different credit limits, collateralisation requirements and other parameters. And yet they could still be connected by gateways allowing liquidity to move between different LETS, if required \u2013 while avoiding exposure to toxic debt.

Cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich ordinary people. Their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital. This is what inspired me. This is my dream. The Ergo Manifesto","title":"LETS"},{"location":"uses/lets/#a-local-exchange-trading-system","text":"A local exchange trading system (LETS) is a local mutual credit association which members are allowed to create common credit money individually, with all the deals in the system written into a common ledger. As an example, assume that Alice with zero balance is willing to buy a liter of raw milk from Bob. First, they agree on a price, for example, assume that the price is about 2 Euro (as Alice and Bob are living in Ireland). After the deal being written into a ledger, Alice's balance becomes -2 (minus two) Euro, and Bob's balance becomes 2 Euro. Then Bob may spend his 2 Euro, for example, on home-made beer from Charlie. Often, such systems impose limits on negative balances, and sometimes even on positive ones, in order to promote exchange in the community. Historically, such systems become popular during crisis times. The first system was established by Michael Linton in a Canadian town stuck in depression back in 1981. Local exchange trading systems were extremely popular during 1998-2002 Argentine Great Depression. Most LETS groups range from 50 to 250 members, with paper-based credit notes and ledger maintained by a core committee. However, paper-based LETS currencies have shown some problems, such as counterfeit notes, possible rogue behavior of system managers, and so on. Therefore, blockchain-based LETS could be superior to the old systems. More information on LETS could be found in \"The Ecology of Money\" book (by Richard Douthwaite) and Wikipedia . In this article we show how LETS could be implemented on top of Ergo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of such kind of community currency on top of a blockchain. Our reference implementation is simple and consists of two contracts, namely, a management contract and an exchange contract. We skip Ergo preliminaries, so please read the ICO article and ErgoScript tutorials( basic and advanced ) for starters. Nevertheless, we are going to introduce a couple of new terms in following sentences. If a token is issued with amount equal to one, we call it the singleton token. Similarly, a box which contains the singleton token is called the singleton box. The management contract is controlling a singleton box which holds members of the LETS system. The contract enables the adding of new members at the pace of one member per one transaction. The box is not storing members, but only a small digest of authenticated data structure built on top of the members' directory. A member is associated with a singleton token issued in a transaction which is adding the member to the directory. The transaction creates a new member's box which contains the member's singleton token. The member's box is protected by the exchange contract. Also, the newly created member's box has initial balance written down into the R4 register, and the balance is equal to zero in our example. The transaction creating a new member must provide a proof of correctness for directory transformation. The management contract box is controlled usually by a committee, and the committee could evolve over time. To support that, we allow committee logic to reside in the register R5. For example, assume that a new committee member has been added along with a new LETS member, the input management contract box is requiring 2-out-of-3 signatures, and the output box requires 3-out-of-4 signatures. In this case contents of the R5 register in the input and the output box would differ. The management contract code in ErgoScript with comments is provided below. Please note that \"userContractHash\" is about exchange contract hash. val selfOut = OUTPUTS(0) // Management script val managementScript = selfOut.R5[SigmaProp].get // The management script template is replicating self, and management script is satisfied val scriptCorrect = (selfOut.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes) && managementScript // A spending transaction is creating boxes for directory, user, fee. val outsSizeCorrect = OUTPUTS.size == 3 // Checks that the management label token is replicating self val outTokenCorrect = (selfOut.tokens.size == 1) && (selfOut.tokens(0)._1 == letsToken) // Checks that new token is issued, and its amount is correct // OUTPUTS(0) tokens already checked via outtokenCorrect val issuedTokenId = INPUTS(0).id val userOut = OUTPUTS(1) val correctTokenAmounts = (userOut.tokens.size == 1 && userOut.tokens(0)._1 == issuedTokenId && userOut.tokens(0)._2 == 1 && OUTPUTS(2).tokens.size == 0 && outTokenCorrect) // Checks that the new user has been created with the zero balance val zeroUserBalance = userOut.R4[Long].get == 0 val properUserScript = blake2b256(userOut.propositionBytes) == userContractHash // Checks that the new token identifier has been added to the directory val selfTree = SELF.R4[AvlTree].get val toAdd: Coll[(Coll[Byte], Coll[Byte])] = Coll((issuedTokenId, Coll[Byte]())) val proof = getVar[Coll[Byte]](1).get val modifiedTree = selfTree.insert(toAdd, proof).get val expectedTree = selfOut.R4[AvlTree].get val treeCorrect = modifiedTree == expectedTree correctTokenAmounts && scriptCorrect && treeCorrect && zeroUserBalance && properUserScript correctTokenAmounts && scriptCorrect && treeCorrect && zeroUserBalance && properUserScript correctTokenAmounts && scriptCorrect && treeCorrect && zeroUserBalance && properUserScript The exchange contract script is fairly straightforward and provided below along with comments describing its logic. In the contract, it is assumed that a spending transaction for an exchange contract box is receiving at least two inputs, and the first two inputs should be protected by the exchange contract script and contain LETS member tokens. To check that singleton member tokens in the inputs do indeed belong to the LETS system, a spending transaction provides the management contract box as the first read-only data input, and also should provide a proof that the member tokens do belong to the directory authenticated via the R4 register of the management contract box. \"letsToken\" in the script is about the singleton token of the management box. // Minimal balance allowed for LETS trader val minBalance = -20000 val lookupProof = getVar[Coll[Byte]](1).get // The read-only box which contains directory of LETS members val treeHolderBox = CONTEXT.dataInputs(0) val properLetsToken = treeHolderBox.tokens(0)._1 == letsToken val membersTree = treeHolderBox.R4[AvlTree].get // A spending transaction is taking two boxes of LETS members willing to make a deal, // and returns boxes with modified balances. val participant0 = INPUTS(0) val participant1 = INPUTS(1) val participantOut0 = OUTPUTS(0) val participantOut1 = OUTPUTS(1) //Check that members do indeed belong to the LETS val token0 = participant0.tokens(0)._1 val token1 = participant1.tokens(0)._1 val memberTokens = Coll(token0, token1) val membersExist = membersTree.getMany(memberTokens, lookupProof).forall({ (o: Option[Coll[Byte]]) => o.isDefined }) // Check that LETS member balance changes during the deal are correct val initialBalance0 = participant0.R4[Long].get val initialBalance1 = participant1.R4[Long].get val finishBalance0 = participantOut0.R4[Long].get val finishBalance1 = participantOut1.R4[Long].get val diff0 = finishBalance0 - initialBalance0 val diff1 = finishBalance1 - initialBalance1 val diffCorrect = diff0 == -diff1 val balancesCorrect = (finishBalance0 > minBalance) && (finishBalance1 > minBalance) && diffCorrect // Check that member boxes save their scripts. // todo: optimization could be made here val script0Saved = participantOut0.propositionBytes == participant0.propositionBytes val script1Saved = participantOut1.propositionBytes == participant1.propositionBytes val scriptsSaved = script0Saved && script1Saved // Member-specific box protection val selfPubKey = SELF.R5[SigmaProp].get selfPubKey && properLetsToken && membersExist && diffCorrect && scriptsSaved Note that both contracts could be modified in many ways to get new systems with different properties. So hopefully some day this article will be continued! A Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) is aimed at developing local economy and is usually used by people of a locality in the vicinity of each other. For a brief overview of LETS see this link , which also describes an ErgoScript implementation of a committee managed LETS. We call such a system a managed or permissioned , since it depends on a committee of trusted members to enroll new members into the LETS. Here we describe a trustless LETS, i.e., one where there is no management committee needed for enrolment.","title":"A Local Exchange Trading System"},{"location":"uses/lets/#overview","text":"LETS involves several parties that agree to use some form of \"local currency\", usually pegged to the country's main currency at a 1:1 rate. Assume that our LETS is based in a European country where the currency is Euros, and the exchange is done in \"local Euros\", which are considered to be equivalent to national Euros. Each user in LETS has an account, which contains the LETS balance of that user (in Local Euros). On joining, each user has a balance of zero. The balance is stored in a (possibly decentralized) ledger. An interesting feature of LETS is that a user with zero balance can also \"withdraw\" money, but only for paying another LETS user. At any time the sum of LETS balances of all the users is zero. As an example, Alice with zero balance wishes to purchase one liter of milk for 2 Euros from Bob who is also a member of LETS with zero balance. She transfers 2 Euros from her account to Bob's, making her balance -2 and Bob's +2. Bob can then transfer some or all of his balance to another LETS user in exchange for goods or services.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"uses/lets/#trustless-lets","text":"Since we desire a trustless LETS, we cannot depend on any trusted group of people to admit users. Note that we will still have a committee to perform some tasks such as setting up the LETS parameters (local currency, the maximum number of members, etc) and consuming any joining fee. We will only assume a trusted pricing oracle that gives the current rate of euros to ergs identified by some global id ( rateTokenID ) and a singleton box containing exactly one token with this id. A singleton box, described here , is a box containing a singleton token , i.e., a token with only one quantity in existence. This box also contains the rate of ergs to euros at any given period of time. The rate is updated by spending this box and creating another singleton box with the new rate. At any instance, our LETS is uniquely defined by a global token box that contains some membership tokens with id letsTokenID . This box defines the LETS parameters such as the location, the currency unit, rateTokenID , etc. The token box is initially started with, say, 10000 membership tokens. Users can spend this box and create their individual LETS boxes as outputs of the transaction, such that each such output has exactly one membership token and the balance membership tokens are put in a newly created token box. A LETS box represents a LETS member and must be used in every transaction. For simplicity, this article restricts all LETS transaction to involve exactly two members, one being the sender and the other the receiver, such that the sender transfers some positive amount of the LETS currency (local euros) to the receiver. Such a transaction consumes the member's boxes and recreates them as output with the updated balance.","title":"Trustless LETS"},{"location":"uses/lets/#the-basic-variant","text":"To prevent spam and DDoS attacks, we require at least some minimum number of ergs ( minErgsToJoin ) to be locked in the newly created member's box.

The last condition requires that either the input and output boxes belong to the receiver (so that the ergs are preserved), or, in case they belong to the sender, a signature is provided and the output is backed by the required number of ergs if its LETS balance is negative. Furthermore, it requires that the sender's ergs balance cannot be reduced until at least minWithdrawTime number of blocks have been mined after the ergs were locked. Compared to the managed LETS, the above system has the following differences: No membership record : Unlike the managed LETS, We don't store any membership information here.

Now, COVID-19 has forced our hands. We cannot delay, and the best way to start is from the grassroots. As lockdowns across the world effectively shut down whole sectors and a large part of the economy, we are entering a new era at breakneck pace. Central banks are taking unprecedented action in the form of money printing but, just like last time around, they will almost certainly fail at the \u2018last mile\u2019 (intentionally or otherwise): while their efforts will benefit the financial sector and the wealthy, the funds will not reach those small businesses and individuals who need them the most.","title":"LETS-4: Positive-Sum, No collateral"},{"location":"uses/lets/#crossing-the-last-mile","text":"Technology like the Ergo platform can address this problem efficiently, building bridges into and within our local economies without the need for commercial or central banks.

A LETS is a mutual credit association in which individual members are allowed to borrow from a common pot of money. All the loans are written into a ledger. Naturally, a blockchain system allows for strict and more granular rules around the size of loans and their use, as well as user privacy. For example, let\u2019s assume Alice has a zero balance. She wants to buy a litre of milk from Bob, and borrows the agreed price of 2 euros from the common pot. Alice\u2019s account now registers -2 euros and Bob\u2019s +2 euros. Bob can spend his balance with other participants of the LETS, and the creation of credit allows for economic activity and velocity of money even where people have, temporarily, no cash.

However, it is unsurprising that paper-based LETS have suffered from problems such as counterfeit notes, dishonest activity by administrators, and so on (much like centralised crypto exchanges). A blockchain-based LETS could be vastly superior to any previous system. Moreover, building lots of small credit systems on the same blockchain enables interoperability and novel financial products designed to strengthen the system as a whole. Hundreds of different LETS could exist, for individuals and small businesses, with different participation criteria, different credit limits, collateralisation requirements and other parameters. And yet they could still be connected by gateways allowing liquidity to move between different LETS, if required \u2013 while avoiding exposure to toxic debt.

Let us know.","title":"Crisis measures"},{"location":"uses/lottery/","text":"First some background The idea in this post is motivated from the post about Proof-of-Activity as a Smart Contract . The goal of \"proof of activity\" is to reward members for their \"activity\" (i.e., for running a full node). Without going into details, the approach essentially is based on \"proof-of-stake\" such that people who are active receive larger rewards than inactive people holding similar stake. The purpose is to discourage people having stake but not actively participating in the network. The key method behind all proof of stake and proof of activity is follow-the-satoshi , which picks a random satoshi from all the generated ones and then the holder of that satoshi is eligible for the reward. If the satoshi is selected unformly then this is similar to a lottery system. The Lottery The goal of this post is not to have a proof of stake or proof of activity. Rather it is about emulating the follow-the-satoshi protocol to have a provably fair lottery system. The lottery that we will create emulates the following physical lottery: 1. Company generates lottery tickets in sequential serial numbers 2. There is only one place to buy the tickets 3. Tickets can only be purchased in sequential serial numbers using the \"next available serial number\" rule, (starting from serial number 0). 4. After the lottery is closed (so that no more tickets can be sold), the first unsold serial number n is noted. 5. A random number r is generated between 0 and n -1 (both inclusive). 6. The holder of ticket with serial number r is the winner. We can emulate this with Ergo as follows. The lottery owner creates a \"lottery box\" containing tokens and the current available serial number in R4 . This is protected by a script that sells tokens and the balance tokens are kept in an identical box with the serial number appropriately incremented. Furthermore the purchased tokens are to be kept in a \"purchase box\" box containing in R4 and R5 respectively, the start and end serial numbers of purchased tokens. We additionally require the script in the purchase box to \"lock\" these values, so they cannot be altered by the buyer. After the lottery ends, the last serial number n is stored in R4 of the lottery box. Using this, winner is decided using, say taking randomness from the previous block header to generate a number uniformly between 0 and n to decide the winner. The winner can use his purchase box to take the rewards. The rewards can be stored in the lottery box itself and each ticket purchased contributes to the reward. While this works in a fair way, it is not deterministic as it depends on the last block header. Since each \"previous block\" decides a different winner for the same n , this also can be used as a proof of activity because the current winner must be onlline.

In short, Bitcoin is actually a much better alternative when it comes to anti-money laundry enforcement when compared to private banking or cold hard cash. So much so, former CIA Acting Director Mitchell Morell revealed that cryptocurrencies between made up to less than 1% of all illicit financial activities between 2017 and 2020. In this report, he mentions that illicit activities with fiat money count for an astonishing 2 to 4% of the U.S.A.\u2019s GDP. Privacy and User Security On the other hand, pseudo-anonymity makes users vulnerable to malicious actors.When receiving a payment, users need to share their public wallet address which exposes the wallet, the transaction and the funds to the entire world which make high-network individuals a target for wary hackers and criminals. A random spy actor can monitors wallets and transactions, and they can devise an attack plan if any security flaws are discovered. This becomes even more dangerous when one considers the potential for data leaks on exchanges or third-party wallets, which may allow nefarious actors to link a wallet to an I.D., social security number, and more. The public and pseudonymous nature of blockchain comes as a double-edged sword. It makes the users vulnerable to attacks, leaks, and other issues. Traditionally, banks and governments keep their centralized ledgers private, which means one must trust the aforementioned entities to remain honest and ensure the safety and liquidity of funds. Money For The People Call for action! As I said earlier, money laundering schemes were around before Bitcoin and even now they take up as much as 1% of total usage in crypto. When regulators are keeping a close eye on the public ledger, with the help of KYC exchanges, they can still know what you\u2019re up to. In a way, you may think that\u2019s okay because governments must prevent black money circulation to stop illegal activities. We think that\u2019s okay too! However, up until now, they were closely following personal bank accounts and the only thing they prevented was individual users from freely using their funds. Big corporations can continue walking around legislation to evade taxes and bad actors use global money laundering schemes to continue using black money. What governments do is keeping a close eye on citizens by seeing them as potential money launderers. How does this sound? Bitcoin FUD(Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) arguments made by regulators were mainly counting on the idea of Bitcoin as a private, anonymous, uncontrollable, and unstoppable money. We know that these cases aren\u2019t true, we saw that cash was the primary money laundering tool and blockchain wallets are traceable. When you withdraw your money to your bank account, governments know what were you doing with your non-custodial wallet. The only case is then, you\u2019re in control of your own funds, and you aren\u2019t using \u201c legal \u201d fiat money controlled by central banks. That makes governments powerless on a global state because they can\u2019t tell you what you should do with your funds or they can\u2019t ban your account when they spot an unexpected activity. What remains is that they can question you about where did you get the money that you withdrew to your central bank account to pay your bills and make shopping etc. Also, they can\u2019t ban your account, for example, when you didn\u2019t pay your debts but let me ask again: Did these powers stop illicit financial activities, or prevent big players from taking delirious debts and going bankrupt? The answer is no, illicit financial activities continue happening elsewhere and institutions can rely on the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d argument with the hope of bail-outs when they need them. Enhancing Privacy and Anonymity For the protection of individuals, we have private chains or \u2018 CoinJoin \u2019 (coinmixer) apps that make users' wallets untraceable. Like I said this doesn\u2019t mean that a user can launder money because every on-chain financial activity must end with an \u201cintegration\u201d phase, which means withdrawing funds to the real, off-chain world. If you can prove that the custody of your funds wasn\u2019t involved in any illicit financial activity, you shouldn\u2019t be prevented from using privacy-enhancing tools to protect yourself in the on-chain world. You hold your keys, you hold your coins or in a reverse phrase- not your keys, not your coins . That also includes custodial exchange wallets because in centralized exchanges this is not any different from using a bank. You aren\u2019t in crypto if you use only centralized exchanges, they can track you, prevent you or on the worst scale they can steal your coins(exit scams). That\u2019s why decentralized finance protocols are entering their golden era now. You don\u2019t have to give up the custody of your funds to use financial applications. Decentralized exchanges are becoming more efficient and cross-chain operations are becoming stronger by supporting all cryptosphere with a single non-custodial wallet. Coin mixing services don\u2019t rely on custodial firms, they are working on zero-knowledge proofs. Decentralized applications are shining in a traditionally controlled government-backed finance world. A new history is upon us and we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Future is very exciting in this sense: Banking the bankless with decentralized applications, giving power to the people, draining seigniorage rights of governments and preventing bail-outs of \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d institutions by infinite money printing -or how is it called in the fancy financial literature- by quantitative easing. Ergo Blockchain provides a non-custodial coinjoin service, the ErgoMixer , as a dApp. It basically protects you from spy agents in the blockchain sphere. It is perfectly secure with its open-source code so that you know what you are interacting with. For more, Ergo Blockchain is a powerful network and it supports Layer 2 services on top of it so anyone can create private side-chains to use blockchain securely. We will provide more updates on the exact details of ErgoMixer later on and new developments on Layer 2 services and privacy focused dApps will soon flourish with new developers coming on board.

Few people are asking what DeFi should look like. Ergo has a vision for what the sector can become. 2020 is shaping up to be the year in which Decentralised Finance rose to mainstream attention, in the same way that Bitcoin and blockchain did in 2016 and 2017. In July alone, Total Value Locked \u2013 the amount of funds committed to DeFi dApps\u2019 smart contracts \u2013 doubled from $2 billion to $4 billion, largely driven by Compound\u2019s distribution of its COMP governance tokens. DeFi is all the rage, with several well-known projects pioneering the space before our eyes. But while the crypto world is gripped with the short-term opportunities of DeFi, fewer are talking about what it actually is \u2013 and fewer still about what it should be. In building a DeFi platform like Ergo, though, that\u2019s exactly the kind of question we have to ask. DeFi dislikes limits In talking about what DeFi \u2018should\u2019 be, it\u2019s easy to fall into a trap of being prescriptive, of introducing arbitrary conditions and limits. But that\u2019s not what blockchain is about. As we\u2019ve seen with Bitcoin and blockchain more generally, there\u2019s a free market of ideas and nothing is off the table. It\u2019s reasonable (though not particularly helpful) to say that DeFi should be \u2018anything and everything\u2019. Just like blockchain, DeFi brings advantages of transparency, immutability and efficiency (often including speed and/or cost) to financial processes. But in terms of what we believe this new set of technologies should offer, and what decentralised finance can bring to the conventional financial system, it\u2019s worth focusing the conversation on a few other key areas that have been overlooked or under-represented to date: Privacy, Scalability, Interoperability , and Decentralisation . Privacy As Eric Hughes wrote in A Cypherpunk\u2019s Manifesto back in 1993, \u2018Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.\u2019 That is never more true than for financial privacy. Privacy must be a built-in feature of DeFi \u2013 not a bolt on extra or a desirable feature. It must be integral. But, as Hughes continues, \u2018Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.\u2019 There is always a balance to be struck between privacy and compliance, between transparency and anonymity. Large scale adoption of DeFi requires auditability, and the regulatory approval that enables. Thanks to the latest advances in zero-knowledge proofs, Ergo can offer both privacy and transparency, where required. The platform\u2019s Sigma Protocols offer robust, customisable cryptography \u2013 and, at the same time, the ability to selectively reveal information where necessary. Scalability The ability to process thousands of transactions per second is also a non-negotiable feature for a thriving DeFi sector. How this is achieved is less important than that it is achieved; in practice, there will be many different approaches, with different users and protocols selecting the ones they prefer. For example, while we have seen the rise of sidechains and child chains, the reality is that exchanges remain a gateway to the blockchain world for a large proportion of users. Popular exchanges are increasingly integrating DeFi functionality, allowing their vast user bases to access it from their individual accounts, without interacting directly with the protocol. While this may be less than ideal from a security perspective, it\u2019s a simple reality that centralised services are not going out of fashion, but are integrating decentralised technologies thanks to the advantages they offer. Ergo has its own approach to scalability , but we can\u2019t and won\u2019t ignore the importance of businesses in driving forward user adoption. Interoperability One of DeFi\u2019s key strengths is composability: the ability to build new applications from existing components, leveraging the network effect of established dApps and tokens. This is one of the main factors that has enabled TVL to explode over the past month. But composability currently has its limits. Cross-platform composability currently isn\u2019t possible. Even atomic swaps \u2013 the first stage of interoperability \u2013 are in their infancy, though Ergo is working on an atomic swap-powered DEX . Full interoperability means the ability for a user to execute a smart contract on one platform and have it seamlessly interact with another blockchain. This would allow truly frictionless cross-protocol interaction, and is what is needed to enable the flow of liquidity fully throughout the DeFi world. At that point, applications become blockchain agnostic, and the platforms are really more like the programming languages for accessing dApps\u2019 functionality. Decentralisation Lastly, and specifically in the context of scalability and interoperability, we cannot forget the importance of decentralisation \u2013 something Ergo has always taken seriously . Of course DeFi is decentralised \u2013 but there are different types of decentralisation. Ethereum, the home of almost every major DeFi dApp, is just one platform. Ethereum\u2019s developers are working on a plan for scaling, but even if this is successful, it is still one blockchain. Should we entrust all our funds to one network? What if a critical bug or exploit is found? Interoperability does more than enable cross-chain liquidity. It decentralises the decentralised infrastructure for DeFi, adding layers of redundancy and security. In the process, it strengthens every blockchain that is a part of that ecosystem, creating a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. At a time when relatively large blockchains still suffer double spend attacks and serious reorgs , and catastrophic vulnerabilities are found in smart contracts holding tens of millions of dollars of value, we cannot assume that one single blockchain will or should rule them all. CDBCs As blockchain technology gains traction, central bank digital currencies are among the most significant applications being developed. But these will inevitably fall far short of the ideal, for one simple reason: control. In particular, that has implications for composability and privacy, and much else besides. Central bank digital currencies are no longer a theoretical application of blockchain technology. The list of countries developing CBDCs is growing rapidly, with several now trialing state-backed digital cash. CDBCs are not built on classic, open blockchain technology. While there are various approaches, they are all based on permissioned ledgers that restrict the role of securing the network and processing transactions to a group of approved entities. They also include a control layer that gives administrators the ability to intervene in transactions, blocking or reversing those they deem invalid. It\u2019s a far cry from the ideals of Bitcoin, and the Ergo platform that aims to build on these. But it\u2019s only to be expected. The state has a role and a remit, and it\u2019s unlikely to give up the control it exercises. Unfortunately, though, there are two ways that holding onto control will mean that CBDCs fall far short of what they could be, meaning they may ultimately cede ground to open platforms like Ergo. Composability As we wrote in a recent blog, composability is a core feature of DeFi. It\u2019s what gives applications network effect, instantly adding value by plugging into existing dapps\u2019 user bases and functionality. Programmable money is a huge development. The current system is clunky and complicated to use, at best. It\u2019s not possible to attach detailed conditions to transactions, and have them interact seamlessly with software, as can be done with blockchain and smart contracts. Imagine the value that could be unlocked if CBDCs were programmable, and smart cash could be integrated frictionlessly into new applications \u2013 banking interfaces, investment services, stores, social networks, games. The list is endless. But this is hardly likely. The freedom to program money will exist, for many years at least, in the open blockchain space alone. Privacy Secondly, we consider privacy to be a core requirement of DeFi. Money is too important to be used as a tool of surveillance, but there is no question that this is what it will become as soon as the first CBDCs are rolled out to a large user base. China is one of the furthest ahead in its creation of state-backed digital cash. This is a state that is notorious for its internet censorship and online surveillance of its population. Its human rights record is dire, and in recent days we have learned more about its oppression of the Uighur minority. Moreover, China already uses a social credit system, which grants or denies citizens access to certain services and amenities depending on their social score, with model citizens enjoying greater privileges. There is, again, no question that a state-backed, traceable CBDC will be used as a tool of surveillance on a scale that is unprecedented in human history. And it will be the same across any nation that implements money within the same framework. That giant eye on the dollar bill? You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. Private, programmable financial services Ergo has a very different vision for blockchain-based cash and financial services. In the new paradigm of blockchain, value is not retained by constraining it. It is only maximised through open systems that make it as accessible as people want it to be. Money without borders, in both senses: cash that can be programmed, sent and received freely but privately, between any two individuals or organisations \u2013 and even blockchains \u2013 anywhere in the world. This is what money needs to be, and what Ergo is building. This is the first in a series of articles speculating on how the fast-emerging DeFi sector might evolve in the coming years. The DeFi movement as it currently exists is only a few months old, and blockchain itself has barely existed a decade. Already, though, we are beginning to see themes crystallising and the first popular use cases becoming established. As a DeFi platform that takes positioning for the future seriously, it\u2019s important that Ergo has a vision \u2013 not only a sense of where things might be heading, but the role that it should itself be playing as these new decentralised financial services consolidate and grow in popularity. While no one can know the future, least of all in this space, a number of trends, technologies, products and use cases are emerging, and it seems that these are starting to plot a certain trajectory. Allowing for necessary course correction as time goes on, where might we see DeFi end up in ten years? Tokens will be the fuel for DeFi, and everything will be tokenised One of the major themes that was becoming apparent, long before the yield farming craze brought DeFi to global attention, is tokenisation. We already have blockchain tokens representing cryptocurrencies and digital assets, and the first shares and other securities have been issued on the blockchain. The benefits are such that the direction of travel is clear. Sooner or later, everything will end up as tokens. For regular, fungible (interchangeable) assets, a regular token will work. Fiat and cryptocurrencies, shares, bonds, precious metals, ETFs, CBDCs \u2013 these will all be freely available on the blockchain. For other assets, NFTs will proliferate. When you buy a car, house, painting or other unique item of value, whether digital or physical, there\u2019s a good chance that transaction will also include a blockchain token. These tokenised assets will place on the blockchain trillions of dollars of value that are currently \u2018stuck\u2019 offline, illiquid or impossible to buy or sell outside of certain limited circles and circumstances. This pool of tokenised value will represent the fuel of the Defi economy: assets that can be traded frictionlessly, borrowed against and leveraged using decentralised protocols that probably won\u2019t look so very different to the ones we use today. Digital identity will become non-negotiable Since these assets will be tradeable on centralised and decentralised exchanges, digital identity will also become an increasingly important theme. This will link blockchain addresses with offline identities, enabling individuals and corporations to operate in a way that is compliant with relevant regulation. It will also allow the automation of tax and accounting processes. To date, digital identity has been an overlooked element of the DeFi ecosystem \u2013 likely due to the use of centralised platforms that can conduct KYC as a condition of use. We\u2019re fast approaching a point where that is no longer a given, with the growth of new forms of decentralised exchange and the increase in volumes moving to these platforms. Stablecoins will become embedded elements of the blockchain One of the biggest use cases for DeFi \u2013 and again one that is often overlooked \u2013 is stablecoins. These exist in many forms, and rely on a range of approaches: centralised and decentralised, collateralised and algorithmic, fiat-backed, and so on. Whatever your preferred approach or view of stablecoins, they are here to stay. They have found use cases as a store of value, especially for traders, and as a popular form of collateral for yield farming. What they haven\u2019t been widely adopted for, yet, is as an integral part of blockchain infrastructure. Transaction fees are almost always paid for with the native blockchain token. Not only does this fluctuate in value, but so does the amount of it required per transaction, depending on both the complexity of the transaction itself and competition for space in the next block. Clearly, this complexity is not conducive to mainstream adoption. End users are best served by simplicity, with minimal burdens for managing multiple tokens. They will want to pay transaction fees in a stable unit of account, and not have to worry about handling the native blockchain token. The solution? An integrated stablecoin that, to most end users, is the most important token on the platform. Two-tier system As a result of this need, it seems likely that we may start to see a two-tier system evolve more clearly. A blockchain such as Ergo will have a native token, which will serve as the underlying currency of payment, just as occurs now. For the most part, though, these will only be handled by more experienced users. These expert users will maintain the technical and financial infrastructure of the DeFi space. For example, they will mine and use the native token as collateral to create a stablecoin, which can be sold into the market for general use, in return for tokenised assets of all kinds. Regular users will then use the \u2018native stablecoin\u2019 in all their business, as a kind of standard reserve currency. It will be used to buy other assets; it will be lent to users against other tokenised assets as collateral (houses, cars, real estate and much more); and it will be used to pay transaction fees. The miners who receive this native stablecoin can hold it as it is, to pay for electricity and hardware costs, or they can convert it back to the platform token or other assets \u2013 that is up to them. These are just some of the themes we are starting to see emerging in the DeFi world, and how they might develop over time. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll explore various other ideas as the space continues to evolve and Ergo launches new technology. Ergo enables new models of financial interaction, underpinned by smart contracts built on flexible and powerful Sigma protocols but easily accessible to developers. One of the most exciting things about blockchain is the possibility of making digital agreements without any trusted intermediaries. In the simplest use case, pioneered by Bitcoin, Alice can send a payment directly to Bob, wherever the two of them are located around the world, with no bank or any trusted third party needed. However, with the functionality of a modern blockchain like Ergo, it is possible to make far more complex and sophisticated financial agreements than simple payments. Take the following example. Gold-backed tokens Alice uses ERGs to purchase gold-backed tokens from Bob. Bob stores the gold in a secure vault, and uses the blockchain to issue one token for every Troy ounce of gold he has. Alice can then use these tokens freely in different contracts, transferring and trading them under whatever conditions she specifies in the smart contract code. When Alice wants to sell the tokens for physical gold, she can conduct another transaction with Bob, receiving ERG in return, at market price. The point of blockchain contracts is to eliminate the need for trust. While the purchase transaction is now trustless, in this instance Alice still needs to trust Bob about two things. Firstly, Bob may refuse to swap the gold tokens back to ERG at the correct price when Alice wants to sell. Secondly, Bob may default on his obligations \u2013 running away with the gold, or misusing the funds he receives and running a fractional reserve. Extending the contracts To address these issues, we can create an Oracle, or decentralised price feed. This uses multiple sources of external data to record the price of gold to the blockchain at regular intervals. This price feed will be the reference point for the redemption contract that manages the sale of Alice\u2019s gold with Bob (or any other participant). Thus the system automatically enforces the right price when a swap takes place. The second situation requires a third-party insurer, Charlie, whose service is also hosted on the blockchain with a smart contract. When Alice purchases gold from Bob, she additionally buys an insurance contract from Charlie. The payment can be dependent on factors including the amount of insurance required, and Bob\u2019s reputation \u2013 again, managed by a decentralized feedback mechanism. Now, if Bob defaults, Alice will automatically receive the value of her gold tokens, with Charlie effectively acting as a buyer of last resort. Programmable contracts There are, of course, many other example use cases like this one. We can also extend this use case, adding further economic actors. For example, Charlie may sell shares in his insurance business to Dave and other participants, providing them with a proportion of revenues in return for ensuring he has the capital he needs to cover any liabilities from the outset. However, even the most complex use case is simpler than general-purpose software that can be used to program any contract. After all, generalised logic must be both far-reaching and secure. Moreover, even a specialised contract is made up of many steps, each of which is fairly simple. Thus another requirement for a general-purpose platform is that it should simplify the process of writing contracts, making them as accessible (and safe) as possible. This can be achieved with the use of template agreements, with customisable parameters. The insurance contract above could be based on a module with flexible parameters, for example. This could be used and reused in many different circumstances. Ergo\u2019s approach This is essentially the approach that Ergo takes, providing superior support for real-world financial agreements. It does this through: Support for multi-stage contracts ( watch details for developers ) A simple high-level language, ErgoScript, enabling clear descriptions of contractual logic Support for formal verification of contracts for improved security guarantees (Ergo Platform deployed its first formally verified p2p crowdfunding contract just three months after the network launched) Easy Oracle creation Native support for complex signature schemes In short, creating financial contracts on the blockchain isn\u2019t just about the functionality you provide. It\u2019s about making that functionality safe and accessible, as well as powerful. Ergo achieves this and more. As the next financial crisis takes hold, it\u2019s clear that conventional monetary policy is at its limit. Smart contract platforms like Ergo enable more innovative, targeted implementations of economic stimulation that the conventional banking sector cannot achieve. Conventional monetary policy is a hammer. It works as far as it goes, but if all you have is a hammer then every problem starts to look like a nail. When the Global Financial Crisis hit over a decade ago, central banks did what they were used to doing. Cutting interest rates means it\u2019s cheaper to borrow money, so there\u2019s more cash in the system that can be spent and will circulate in the economy \u2013 paying for goods and services, funding employment and allowing life to continue something like as normal. That, at any rate, is the theory. It\u2019s what central banks do in recessions to stimulate economic activity. When times are better, they raise interest rates to make it more expensive to borrow money and prevent the economy from overheating (including asset bubbles). The outer limits This is a blunt tool, but it works, up to a point. In the 2008 crisis, the problem was more severe \u2013 so severe, in fact, that interest rates were slashed to zero. Banks were still afraid to lend because they didn\u2019t know the quality of the collateral they were offered in return, those notorious mortgage-backed securities. So the central banks undertook a programme of Quantitative Easing (QE). This entailed creating huge amounts of cash that didn\u2019t exist before, then purchasing various assets from the banks. The idea was that the central bank would take on the risk and the assets, and commercial banks would then use this gift of liquidity to lend to small businesses and individuals, allowing them to continue operating as before. It didn\u2019t work. Little of that newly-created money went to small businesses. Instead, banks used it to shore up their own balance sheets and make their own finances safer, investing only in low-risk assets rather than risky SMEs. Ultimately that cash filtered through to assets like the stock market and property, making the wealthy even more wealthy while the poorer were priced out of the market. Helicopter money Today, as we experience the greatest financial challenge of our lifetimes \u2013 greater than even the Global Financial Crisis \u2013 central banks are considering even more unorthodox approaches. One of these is \u2018helicopter money\u2019. This involves cash being simply airdropped directly to citizens, either in the form of tax breaks or as money straight into their bank accounts. America has discussed giving \\$1,200 to every adult. Other nations are exploring the same idea. But there\u2019s a problem with this, too. Just like the banks, ordinary citizens are worried about their finances. So instead of going out and spending (where \u2018going out\u2019 is even possible), they pay down their debt. That newly-printed money goes nowhere. That\u2019s really as far as central banks can go. But a platform like Ergo can offer different types of money, with different conditions attached via smart contracts, incentivising different behaviour in different circumstances. And that enables a whole different range of monetary policy tools. \u2018Hot potato\u2019 money In normal times, banks seek to maintain an inflation rate of around 2%. This means money is worth less over time. So instead of saving it all, and seeing the value of their savings fall, citizens have the incentive to spend it and circulate it within the economy. Too much inflation, of course, is a bad thing. Get money printing wrong and you have hyperinflation like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, and your economy collapses. But what if we kept inflation low, but created a limited amount of a special class of money that had to be used quickly if it was to retain its value at all? We\u2019ll call this \u2018hot potato\u2019 money, because it has to be passed on fast. Using a blockchain and smart contracts, this would be a simple matter of creating a new token that could be freely transferred and traded, just like any other token. And it could be backed by reserves (held with the central bank, commercial banks or any other entity). But the difference would be that it has to be spent within a month of receiving it, or those tokens are locked, their value is lost to the holder and the funds that back them are freed up to return to the reserve holder. So this would be regular money that people had to spend: use it or lose it. If they hoard it, it becomes useless. And we can ensure that it is not used to pay down debt by including conditions that ensure it cannot be used by the banking sector. Of course, Ergo\u2019s Sigma protocols can be used to figure out what has been spent, where, without knowing individual spending habits \u2013 enabling even more targeted stimulus. This idea likely has far-reaching implications \u2013 and possibly unintended consequences. What would the result be, for example, of creating different \u2018classes\u2019 of money that were only semi-interchangeable? Would this introduce unwelcome, even dangerous friction? This and other questions would need to be explored further. What\u2019s clear is that central banks are already experimenting with unconventional monetary policy and are fast reaching the end of the road. We can continue that experiment with better, more powerful and targeted tools. Powerful But Safe Contracts Ethereum is an exceptional platform, but there are things it does not do well. Its Turing-complete smart contracts are powerful, but dangerous \u2013 as incidents from The DAO to the Parity wallet exploits have proven, with tens of millions of dollars in collateral damage. With complexity comes uncertainty, and potentially catastrophic vulnerabilities. Contracts can be expensive to run, and depending on network conditions may execute unpredictably \u2013 or not at all. Ergo takes a fundamentally different approach to smart contract development. The team, which has extensive experience with blockchain platforms, frameworks and organisations from Nxt and Waves to Scorex and IOHK, has adopted a declarative model for programming whereby it\u2019s always known in advance how much code will cost to run \u2013 and, indeed, whether it will run precisely as intended. While that might on the surface limit code complexity, it\u2019s nevertheless possible to create Turing-complete scripts by iterating processes across multiple blocks. That means Ergo can support versatile dApps that run predictably, with known costs, and don\u2019t have any of the dangers of unrestricted functionality. Sigma protocols The platform is unashamedly conservative, basing as many features as possible on Bitcoin \u2013 after all, Bitcoin is the most battle-tested crypto network in existence. Ergo\u2019s UTXO model, PoW mining and finite supply draw on Bitcoin\u2019s approaches to consensus and economic incentives. But Ergo also incorporates cutting-edge research into new cryptographic processes, using Sigma protocols to enable DeFi applications that would be either complex and messy or simply impossible on other platforms. Sigma protocols are a well-known class of zero-knowledge proofs that allow developers to implement very powerful processes very elegantly. For example, what if you want to build a privacy service that allows any one of a dozen different accounts to spend funds from an address \u2013 but no one can tell who has made each transfer? Such a \u2018ring contract\u2019 is possible with Ethereum, but it would require a clunky and expensive workaround. With Ergo\u2019s Sigma protocols, it\u2019s possible to implement this kind of use case and many others quickly, efficiently and \u2013 above all \u2013 securely. Sigma protocols have not been deployed in such generic form within crypto before. Yet this kind of out-of-the-box functionality is hugely valuable, especially when no other DeFi platform offers it. Ergo enables new models of financial interaction, underpinned by smart contracts built on flexible and powerful Sigma protocols but easily accessible to developers. One of the most exciting things about blockchain is the possibility of making digital agreements without any trusted intermediaries. In the simplest use case, pioneered by Bitcoin, Alice can send a payment directly to Bob, wherever the two of them are located around the world, with no bank or any trusted third party needed. However, with the functionality of a modern blockchain like Ergo, it is possible to make far more complex and sophisticated financial agreements than simple payments. Take the following example. Gold-backed tokens Alice uses ERGs to purchase gold-backed tokens from Bob. Bob stores the gold in a secure vault, and uses the blockchain to issue one token for every Troy ounce of gold he has. Alice can then use these tokens freely in different contracts, transferring and trading them under whatever conditions she specifies in the smart contract code. When Alice wants to sell the tokens for physical gold, she can conduct another transaction with Bob, receiving ERG in return, at market price. The point of blockchain contracts is to eliminate the need for trust. While the purchase transaction is now trustless, in this instance Alice still needs to trust Bob about two things. Firstly, Bob may refuse to swap the gold tokens back to ERG at the correct price when Alice wants to sell. Secondly, Bob may default on his obligations \u2013 running away with the gold, or misusing the funds he receives and running a fractional reserve. Extending the contracts To address these issues, we can create an Oracle, or decentralised price feed. This uses multiple sources of external data to record the price of gold to the blockchain at regular intervals. This price feed will be the reference point for the redemption contract that manages the sale of Alice\u2019s gold with Bob (or any other participant). Thus the system automatically enforces the right price when a swap takes place. The second situation requires a third-party insurer, Charlie, whose service is also hosted on the blockchain with a smart contract. When Alice purchases gold from Bob, she additionally buys an insurance contract from Charlie. The payment can be dependent on factors including the amount of insurance required, and Bob\u2019s reputation \u2013 again, managed by a decentralized feedback mechanism. Now, if Bob defaults, Alice will automatically receive the value of her gold tokens, with Charlie effectively acting as a buyer of last resort. Programmable contracts There are, of course, many other example use cases like this one. We can also extend this use case, adding further economic actors. For example, Charlie may sell shares in his insurance business to Dave and other participants, providing them with a proportion of revenues in return for ensuring he has the capital he needs to cover any liabilities from the outset. However, even the most complex use case is simpler than general-purpose software that can be used to program any contract. After all, generalised logic must be both far-reaching and secure. Moreover, even a specialised contract is made up of many steps, each of which is fairly simple. Thus another requirement for a general-purpose platform is that it should simplify the process of writing contracts, making them as accessible (and safe) as possible. This can be achieved with the use of template agreements, with customisable parameters. The insurance contract above could be based on a module with flexible parameters, for example. This could be used and reused in many different circumstances. Ergo\u2019s approach This is essentially the approach that Ergo takes, providing superior support for real-world financial agreements. It does this through: Support for multi-stage contracts ( watch details for developers ) A simple high-level language, ErgoScript, enabling clear descriptions of contractual logic Support for formal verification of contracts for improved security guarantees (Ergo Platform deployed its first formally verified p2p crowdfunding contract just three months after the network launched) Easy Oracle creation Native support for complex signature schemes In short, creating financial contracts on the blockchain isn\u2019t just about the functionality you provide. It\u2019s about making that functionality safe and accessible, as well as powerful. Ergo achieves this and more. DeFi dApps have overloaded the Ethereum blockchain, causing long delays and soaring fees for transactions. Ethereum and many other platforms besides have researched and implemented fixes to address the lack of capacity. However, all of the solutions are imperfect in one way or another. Larger blocks are the obvious but clumsy fix, resulting in centralisation as fewer miners can afford the bandwidth, storage and CPU cycles to participate. Reducing the number of block validators \u2013 another approach taken to increase throughput \u2013 also necessarily centralises the blockchain. Sharding, while potentially very promising, has yet to be implemented successfully, and in some proposed implementations, breaks atomic composability because shards cannot communicate seamlessly. Thus many of the ways projects seek to ensure their blockchains are fit for purpose result in greater centralisation or loss of critical functionality. Marginal gains Ergo\u2019s developers are watching developments in the DeFi space closely, especially some of the proposals that aim to scale blockchains while maintaining security, decentralisation and atomic composability. In the meantime, there is much that can be done to improve blockchain capacity. The concept of \u2018marginal gains\u2019, often applied in sports, is useful: a number of small, incremental gains in different areas all add up to a substantial compound effect. For Ergo, there are several design principles and choices that have been taken to realise efficiencies in different areas. Storage rent is akin to \u2018on-chain garbage collection\u2019, reducing blockchain bloat and lowering the long-term costs of mining, improving economic sustainability. NiPoPoWs (non-interactive proof-of-proof-of-works) enable mobile SPV clients and even lite full nodes , again reducing the barriers to maintaining the network and improving decentralisation. A smart contract language that is finite and clear, without the messiness and possible chain bloat of Turing-complete languages and their unintended consequences. Sigma Protocols , which allow for powerful cryptographic use cases, implemented elegantly and efficiently. As DeFi emerges as a major use case for blockchain, the stakes could not be higher. Blockchains that are fit for purpose will thrive; those that do not allow the functionality to sustain the required transaction load simply cannot establish a foothold. At the same time moving too fast and implementing untested technology is equally dangerous. There are efficiencies to be gained in first-generation blockchains. Ergo continues to prioritise this approach while researching future upgrades. Ergo Blockchain is Layer 1 Protocol for powerful Decentralized Finance Contracts that builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. The Proof of Work consensus algorithm and underlying UTxO model enable robust scalability and security. Ergo is also partnered with EMURGO , the commercial arm of Cardano, to improve research on blockchain and zero-knowledge ecosystems. To check out some smart contract deployments, see our GitHub repositories here and here . Stablecoin Blockchain assets can be extremely volatile. That\u2019s why investors often seek digital assets which are pegged to national currencies. A Stablecoin is the most primitive integration of cryptocurrencies with the off-chain world. Until DAI, fiat custody services were provided by centralized services. The first example of a stable coin, USDT, is backed by actual dollars held in banks. However, for a decentralized financial system, we need other means of fiat-pegged currencies. Launched in February, Ergo\u2019s native stablecoin SigUSD is based on AgeUSD protocol to provide a robust Reserve/Mint contract. Providing a truly decentralized finance experience. It\u2019s collateralized with its own native cryptocurrency reserves ERG using SigRSV as the trust component which gives SigUSD\u2019s $1 value. SigRSV collateral ratio is set to a minimum of a 400% ratio with SigUSD. This design prohibits liquidations such as we saw in 2020 March crash . As Emurgo states, \"Black Thursday,\" when MakerDAO CDPs were triggered for liquidation due to volatility and then sold for $0 due to blockchain congestion that prevented others from bidding, demonstrated that a new design is needed. For SigmaUSD, this scenario is not possible. Oracle Oracles are the backbone of a decentralized financial system. It connects off-chain data with the on-chain world. Normally, ETH has no info about the current market price. During a swap order in a decentralized exchange, a swap contract needs to call the data from various data sources to obtain market price. Thus, oracles are the messengers of the crypto ecosystem. Not only in atomic swaps but also in more complex interactions such as lending/borrowing assets or dynamic market-making need the data feeds provided by oracles. DeFi ecosystem suffered from Flash Loan attacks, caused by misinformation from centralized price oracles . Ergo developed Oracle Pools to maintain a robust DeFi ecosystem. Because of the eUTXO design and its rich programming language ErgoScript, oracle networks can be more decentralized. In the extended UTXO model, we have a lot of flexibility and power available to build new protocols. This can be utilized to construct oracle datapoint hierarchies of confidence. In short, they are an abstraction above oracle pools which allows us to scale the benefits of oracle pools as much as we desire, at the cost of price and speed. ERG/USD oracle pool is running on Ergo Blockchain. NFT Blockchains aren\u2019t only about cryptocurrencies. Audio or visual artworks can also be deployed on immutable smart contracts of blockchains. These artworks are represented by Non-Fungible Tokens . Furthermore, artworks can be traded in decentralized auction houses. This would help artists to reach the world without any restriction of governments or without any need for centralized licensing firms. It means the democratization of art markets with the help of public blockchain. Some examples like Rarible or Opensea are auction markets running on Ethereum Network. Any artist can create and sell their artwork in there, however, gas prices to mint an NFT can take up to $100. Ergo\u2019s scalable and faster design would reduce the gas costs to almost zero, without giving up security or speed. Ergo NFT Auctionhouse is open for months and it allows listings for a picture, audio, or any other kind of non-fungible tokens. DEX Until 2020 DeFi Summer, Value Locked in DeFi ( TVL ) was too low to use the platforms effectively. After an increasing interest and new token issuance every day, Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) came into the sunlight. Their benefits are for people who don\u2019t want to give up the custody of their funds. DEXes democratized the exchange experience for both blockchain developers and crypto investors. ErgoDEX can provide more functions than Ethereum based DEXes. ErgoDEX has more properties such as limit orders, partial filling, and buy-back supports. Ergo\u2019s Multi-Stage Contracts allows for timed release payments, so a code implemented in the contract can help investors to cancel their order with a minimal loss if the developers of the project don\u2019t deliver their promises. With the implementation of NIPoPoWS, DEX will be interoperable in both PoS and PoW blockchains. Users can enjoy the freedom of exchanges with self-custodial wallets. DAO DAO stands for Decentral Autonomous Organizations . Cryptocurrencies are decentralized (not all of them!), and so their platforms. The governance of these platforms is run by decentralized entities. Every decision is made by pseudo-anonym individuals of DeFi platforms for prohibiting the centralization of power. Therefore, certain tokens are used for voting or making enhancements to these DeFi platforms. New coin issuances , redefinition of purposes etc. are all very vital features and can\u2019t be left to a small group of individuals if the crypto ecosystem is for the masses. Zero-Knowledge Treasury Vaults with multi-key signature are the first example of a DAO in Ergo Blockchain. Lending - Borrowing Lending and borrowing are two components that increase liquidity flow in financial systems. For example, you have Bitcoins but you want to leverage your holding without selling your BTC. So, you can stake your BTC (you can also use your house as collateral in this sense) as collateral to borrow SigUSD and use it in exchanges or yield farming protocols. On the other side of your interaction, another user can leverage her unused SigUSD by staking in the lending protocol. Traditional banks have very low-interest rates and they might suck up a lot of revenue from your deposits. With decentral lending protocols such as Compound , users will be able to use lend/borrow services and move their funds across all crypto ecosystems without any need for centralized platforms such as banks or exchanges. Crypto lending protocols are open to more experimental designs such as interest-free loans , innovating even more use cases on blockchains. Derivatives Besides buying and selling the tokens of a protocol, traders also want to monetize via various strategies such as options or leveraged future contracts. In traditional finance, these tools are provided by brokerage firms and in the crypto world by centralized exchanges. However, this can turn out to be very harmful towards traders by making exchanges big casinos who can see the player\u2019s hands. That\u2019s why in decentralized finance, there is also an alternative as options or derivatives trading smart contract platform. Synthetix is an example of leveraged assets trading platform. The platform token creates liquidity for the traders who want to take leveraged positions. Hegic on the other hand provides an options trading platform for traders who wants to bet on call-put options via smart contracts. These are just two examples of derivatives protocols on Ethereum. Ergo Blockchain\u2019s Multi-Stage Contracts can also provide these protocols on top of it. Insurance Another big sector of the finance industry is Insurance. Every exchangeable asset carries a risk of losing it, whether by unprecedented risks such as taking a bullet to your Ledger Wallet or foreseeable risks such as rug pulls . New protocols emerged such as Nexus Mutual to tackle the decentral insurance problem. If you think about insurance, it pays a premium to risk bearers in case a bad event happens, exchanging your money for security. In a Decentralized Insurance platform: Your participation, risk bearers\u2019 participation and validation of the trade by oracles can all be governed by smart contracts to create a smoothly functioning DeFi ecosystem. Yield Aggregation So after an expansion of new decentralized exchanges such as Bancor , Balancer , Uniswap , Sushiswap , and Curve , people are started to look for easier ways to move capital around those exchanges to create the best yields. Yield Aggregators are helping users to automate the liquidity farming actions. The first example of a yield aggregation protocol is Yearn Finance . In the protocol, users can choose different yield farming strategies among the vaults deployed. Not only users but also developers can leverage yield farming platforms by creating their unique yield farming strategies and deploying them on protocols. Such examples will be very useful for market-making algorithms in the future by supporting deep liquidity all across DeFi. Index Coins Not all crypto investors are conscient about different blockchain use cases. Some of the investors may want to benefit from indexed tokens to invest in various cryptocurrencies. For such an innovation dynamic market-making(DMM) algorithms would be necessary to adjust the funds after price changes. Besides, people who will release index tokens must have the market knowledge to decide which tokens must be involved in the indexed and for how many percentage. Some examples of index coins running on Ethereum are ASSY, YETI, PIPT, YLA issued by Powerpool Protocol . Asset Tokenization Asset Tokenization is meeting traditional financial assets with crypto. A centralized exchange FTX provides US stocks in exchange for cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon, however, is very new due to regulation problems. Stock tokens are not yet traded on decentralized exchanges. Another example of tokenization of real-world assets would be real estate tokenization. With the help of cryptocurrencies, houses can be fractionated into thousands of tokens representing real estate. These kinds of implementations will help retail investors to invest in houses all around the world with minimal savings. All the utilities of traditional banks are becoming decentralized applications on smart contract platforms. Ergo is providing robust and rich infrastructure with ErgoScript language to support a complex DeFi ecosystem powered by Multi-Stage Contracts . Why Ergo Ergo is the inevitable next step in the evolution of Proof of Work blockchain technology, designed for creating and implementing powerful, efficient and highly secure financial contracts. It is an open-source, decentralized network that builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. It complements tried and tested principles with the latest peer-reviewed academic research into cryptography, consensus models, and digital currencies. Evolution of Ergo Ergo\u2019s native language, Ergoscript, was created by Alex Chepurnoy, the primary developer of Ergo. Before his work and research with Ergo, Chepurnoy was an IOHK research fellow and served as the project manager of Scorex where he helped design and build its modular blockchain framework. As a core developer of NXT, Chepurnoy was integral in the development of its pure Proof of Stake cryptocurrency, the first of its kind. The work on color coins at NXT was instrumental in developing the necessary foundations for creating advanced markets operating on a blockchain. Ergoscript - Unlocking Financial Empowerment Ergoscript\u2019s language is founded on the use of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, or \u03a3-protocols (Sigma Protocols). It is a Scala-based language and therefore benefits from the stateless framework which allows for formal verification on contract logic, granting developers and programmers the ability to create smart contracts with features such as ring-signatures, multisignatures, multiple currencies, self-replicating scripts, anti-theft features, and enhanced security. Ergoscript truly increases the creative potential of blockchain technology and allows for an incredible variety of DeFi products and financial services. To further explore the intrinsic properties of Ergo\u2019s \u03a3-protocols, please see Whitepaper II and Whitepaper III on the Ergo Platform website. A Commitment to Continued Open Source Community-Based Work and Collaboration Community is integral to the identity of Ergo while it continues to build financial frameworks that benefit everyday users. The cryptocurrency industry would not exist if not for decades of collaboration between technologists, scientists and mathematicians. Ergo continues the spirit of collaboration for the benefit of humanity by providing tools to disintermediate power and give it to the people. This is paramount to Alex Chepurnoy\u2019s life work. The Ergo Manifesto provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion on Chepurnoy\u2019s inspiration for Ergo. Cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich ordinary people. Their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital. This is what inspired me. This is my dream. I hope Ergo will be useful here. Thousands of small cooperatives and individual entrepreneurs are more important to healthy and sustainable wealth growth around the globe than a couple of corporations hiding profits in offshore heavens. Chepurnoy works directly with a team of 15 developers, some of whom oversee and manage development teams. Ergo\u2019s growing environment strives to maintain a strong synergy between developers, the Ergo Foundation, and other community contributors with the goal of creating high-quality dApps that provide a rich user experience. Ergo Ecosystem The user experience includes the NFT Auction House , a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin protocol, SigmaUSD , secure and efficient Oracle Pools , and increased financial privacy with ErgoMixer . Users will soon be able to access the non-custodial, decentralized exchange, ErgoDex , and its ability to provide efficient and secure transactions between the Ergo and Cardano blockchains. The Proof of Work consensus algorithm and underlying extended UTxO model empowers Ergo to always offer scalable and secure solutions. There are several other exciting projects in the works such as ErgoFund, LETS, Ergo.Meta --- and more community made dApps are starting to appear on the back of the Hackathon. Ergo Partnerships Ergo is proud to partner with EMURGO, the commercial arm of Cardano, in improving research on blockchain and zero-knowledge ecosystems. The upcoming integration with Waves Network will also see Ergo implement cross-chain functionality with all Waves enabled blockchains. Additionally, Ergo continues to support the security and protection of individuals in the crypto space as a member of the blockchain alliance, BPSAA.","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"uses/use/#privacy","text":"As Eric Hughes wrote in A Cypherpunk\u2019s Manifesto back in 1993, \u2018Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.\u2019 That is never more true than for financial privacy. Privacy must be a built-in feature of DeFi \u2013 not a bolt on extra or a desirable feature. It must be integral. But, as Hughes continues, \u2018Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.\u2019 There is always a balance to be struck between privacy and compliance, between transparency and anonymity. Large scale adoption of DeFi requires auditability, and the regulatory approval that enables. Thanks to the latest advances in zero-knowledge proofs, Ergo can offer both privacy and transparency, where required. The platform\u2019s Sigma Protocols offer robust, customisable cryptography \u2013 and, at the same time, the ability to selectively reveal information where necessary.","title":"Privacy"},{"location":"uses/use/#scalability","text":"The ability to process thousands of transactions per second is also a non-negotiable feature for a thriving DeFi sector. How this is achieved is less important than that it is achieved; in practice, there will be many different approaches, with different users and protocols selecting the ones they prefer. For example, while we have seen the rise of sidechains and child chains, the reality is that exchanges remain a gateway to the blockchain world for a large proportion of users. Popular exchanges are increasingly integrating DeFi functionality, allowing their vast user bases to access it from their individual accounts, without interacting directly with the protocol. While this may be less than ideal from a security perspective, it\u2019s a simple reality that centralised services are not going out of fashion, but are integrating decentralised technologies thanks to the advantages they offer. Ergo has its own approach to scalability , but we can\u2019t and won\u2019t ignore the importance of businesses in driving forward user adoption.","title":"Scalability"},{"location":"uses/use/#interoperability","text":"One of DeFi\u2019s key strengths is composability: the ability to build new applications from existing components, leveraging the network effect of established dApps and tokens. This is one of the main factors that has enabled TVL to explode over the past month. But composability currently has its limits. Cross-platform composability currently isn\u2019t possible. Even atomic swaps \u2013 the first stage of interoperability \u2013 are in their infancy, though Ergo is working on an atomic swap-powered DEX . Full interoperability means the ability for a user to execute a smart contract on one platform and have it seamlessly interact with another blockchain. This would allow truly frictionless cross-protocol interaction, and is what is needed to enable the flow of liquidity fully throughout the DeFi world. At that point, applications become blockchain agnostic, and the platforms are really more like the programming languages for accessing dApps\u2019 functionality.","title":"Interoperability"},{"location":"uses/use/#decentralisation","text":"Lastly, and specifically in the context of scalability and interoperability, we cannot forget the importance of decentralisation \u2013 something Ergo has always taken seriously . Of course DeFi is decentralised \u2013 but there are different types of decentralisation. Ethereum, the home of almost every major DeFi dApp, is just one platform. Ethereum\u2019s developers are working on a plan for scaling, but even if this is successful, it is still one blockchain. Should we entrust all our funds to one network? What if a critical bug or exploit is found? Interoperability does more than enable cross-chain liquidity. It decentralises the decentralised infrastructure for DeFi, adding layers of redundancy and security. In the process, it strengthens every blockchain that is a part of that ecosystem, creating a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. At a time when relatively large blockchains still suffer double spend attacks and serious reorgs , and catastrophic vulnerabilities are found in smart contracts holding tens of millions of dollars of value, we cannot assume that one single blockchain will or should rule them all.","title":"Decentralisation"},{"location":"uses/use/#cdbcs","text":"As blockchain technology gains traction, central bank digital currencies are among the most significant applications being developed. But these will inevitably fall far short of the ideal, for one simple reason: control. In particular, that has implications for composability and privacy, and much else besides. Central bank digital currencies are no longer a theoretical application of blockchain technology. The list of countries developing CBDCs is growing rapidly, with several now trialing state-backed digital cash. CDBCs are not built on classic, open blockchain technology. While there are various approaches, they are all based on permissioned ledgers that restrict the role of securing the network and processing transactions to a group of approved entities. They also include a control layer that gives administrators the ability to intervene in transactions, blocking or reversing those they deem invalid. It\u2019s a far cry from the ideals of Bitcoin, and the Ergo platform that aims to build on these. But it\u2019s only to be expected. The state has a role and a remit, and it\u2019s unlikely to give up the control it exercises.

Its human rights record is dire, and in recent days we have learned more about its oppression of the Uighur minority. Moreover, China already uses a social credit system, which grants or denies citizens access to certain services and amenities depending on their social score, with model citizens enjoying greater privileges. There is, again, no question that a state-backed, traceable CBDC will be used as a tool of surveillance on a scale that is unprecedented in human history.

Fiat and cryptocurrencies, shares, bonds, precious metals, ETFs, CBDCs \u2013 these will all be freely available on the blockchain. For other assets, NFTs will proliferate. When you buy a car, house, painting or other unique item of value, whether digital or physical, there\u2019s a good chance that transaction will also include a blockchain token. These tokenised assets will place on the blockchain trillions of dollars of value that are currently \u2018stuck\u2019 offline, illiquid or impossible to buy or sell outside of certain limited circles and circumstances. This pool of tokenised value will represent the fuel of the Defi economy: assets that can be traded frictionlessly, borrowed against and leveraged using decentralised protocols that probably won\u2019t look so very different to the ones we use today.","title":"Tokens will be the fuel for DeFi, and everything will be tokenised"},{"location":"uses/use/#digital-identity-will-become-non-negotiable","text":"Since these assets will be tradeable on centralised and decentralised exchanges, digital identity will also become an increasingly important theme. This will link blockchain addresses with offline identities, enabling individuals and corporations to operate in a way that is compliant with relevant regulation.

To date, digital identity has been an overlooked element of the DeFi ecosystem \u2013 likely due to the use of centralised platforms that can conduct KYC as a condition of use. We\u2019re fast approaching a point where that is no longer a given, with the growth of new forms of decentralised exchange and the increase in volumes moving to these platforms.","title":"Digital identity will become non-negotiable"},{"location":"uses/use/#stablecoins-will-become-embedded-elements-of-the-blockchain","text":"One of the biggest use cases for DeFi \u2013 and again one that is often overlooked \u2013 is stablecoins. These exist in many forms, and rely on a range of approaches: centralised and decentralised, collateralised and algorithmic, fiat-backed, and so on. Whatever your preferred approach or view of stablecoins, they are here to stay. They have found use cases as a store of value, especially for traders, and as a popular form of collateral for yield farming. What they haven\u2019t been widely adopted for, yet, is as an integral part of blockchain infrastructure. Transaction fees are almost always paid for with the native blockchain token. Not only does this fluctuate in value, but so does the amount of it required per transaction, depending on both the complexity of the transaction itself and competition for space in the next block. Clearly, this complexity is not conducive to mainstream adoption. End users are best served by simplicity, with minimal burdens for managing multiple tokens. They will want to pay transaction fees in a stable unit of account, and not have to worry about handling the native blockchain token. The solution? An integrated stablecoin that, to most end users, is the most important token on the platform.","title":"Stablecoins will become embedded elements of the blockchain"},{"location":"uses/use/#two-tier-system","text":"As a result of this need, it seems likely that we may start to see a two-tier system evolve more clearly. A blockchain such as Ergo will have a native token, which will serve as the underlying currency of payment, just as occurs now. For the most part, though, these will only be handled by more experienced users. These expert users will maintain the technical and financial infrastructure of the DeFi space. For example, they will mine and use the native token as collateral to create a stablecoin, which can be sold into the market for general use, in return for tokenised assets of all kinds. Regular users will then use the \u2018native stablecoin\u2019 in all their business, as a kind of standard reserve currency. It will be used to buy other assets; it will be lent to users against other tokenised assets as collateral (houses, cars, real estate and much more); and it will be used to pay transaction fees. The miners who receive this native stablecoin can hold it as it is, to pay for electricity and hardware costs, or they can convert it back to the platform token or other assets \u2013 that is up to them. These are just some of the themes we are starting to see emerging in the DeFi world, and how they might develop over time. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll explore various other ideas as the space continues to evolve and Ergo launches new technology. Ergo enables new models of financial interaction, underpinned by smart contracts built on flexible and powerful Sigma protocols but easily accessible to developers. One of the most exciting things about blockchain is the possibility of making digital agreements without any trusted intermediaries. In the simplest use case, pioneered by Bitcoin, Alice can send a payment directly to Bob, wherever the two of them are located around the world, with no bank or any trusted third party needed. However, with the functionality of a modern blockchain like Ergo, it is possible to make far more complex and sophisticated financial agreements than simple payments. Take the following example.","title":"Two-tier system"},{"location":"uses/use/#gold-backed-tokens","text":"Alice uses ERGs to purchase gold-backed tokens from Bob. Bob stores the gold in a secure vault, and uses the blockchain to issue one token for every Troy ounce of gold he has. Alice can then use these tokens freely in different contracts, transferring and trading them under whatever conditions she specifies in the smart contract code. When Alice wants to sell the tokens for physical gold, she can conduct another transaction with Bob, receiving ERG in return, at market price. The point of blockchain contracts is to eliminate the need for trust. While the purchase transaction is now trustless, in this instance Alice still needs to trust Bob about two things. Firstly, Bob may refuse to swap the gold tokens back to ERG at the correct price when Alice wants to sell. Secondly, Bob may default on his obligations \u2013 running away with the gold, or misusing the funds he receives and running a fractional reserve.","title":"Gold-backed tokens"},{"location":"uses/use/#extending-the-contracts","text":"To address these issues, we can create an Oracle, or decentralised price feed. This uses multiple sources of external data to record the price of gold to the blockchain at regular intervals. This price feed will be the reference point for the redemption contract that manages the sale of Alice\u2019s gold with Bob (or any other participant). Thus the system automatically enforces the right price when a swap takes place. The second situation requires a third-party insurer, Charlie, whose service is also hosted on the blockchain with a smart contract. When Alice purchases gold from Bob, she additionally buys an insurance contract from Charlie. The payment can be dependent on factors including the amount of insurance required, and Bob\u2019s reputation \u2013 again, managed by a decentralized feedback mechanism. Now, if Bob defaults, Alice will automatically receive the value of her gold tokens, with Charlie effectively acting as a buyer of last resort.","title":"Extending the contracts"},{"location":"uses/use/#programmable-contracts","text":"There are, of course, many other example use cases like this one. We can also extend this use case, adding further economic actors. For example, Charlie may sell shares in his insurance business to Dave and other participants, providing them with a proportion of revenues in return for ensuring he has the capital he needs to cover any liabilities from the outset. However, even the most complex use case is simpler than general-purpose software that can be used to program any contract. After all, generalised logic must be both far-reaching and secure. Moreover, even a specialised contract is made up of many steps, each of which is fairly simple. Thus another requirement for a general-purpose platform is that it should simplify the process of writing contracts, making them as accessible (and safe) as possible. This can be achieved with the use of template agreements, with customisable parameters. The insurance contract above could be based on a module with flexible parameters, for example. This could be used and reused in many different circumstances.","title":"Programmable contracts"},{"location":"uses/use/#ergos-approach","text":"This is essentially the approach that Ergo takes, providing superior support for real-world financial agreements.

It\u2019s about making that functionality safe and accessible, as well as powerful. Ergo achieves this and more. As the next financial crisis takes hold, it\u2019s clear that conventional monetary policy is at its limit. Smart contract platforms like Ergo enable more innovative, targeted implementations of economic stimulation that the conventional banking sector cannot achieve. Conventional monetary policy is a hammer. It works as far as it goes, but if all you have is a hammer then every problem starts to look like a nail. When the Global Financial Crisis hit over a decade ago, central banks did what they were used to doing. Cutting interest rates means it\u2019s cheaper to borrow money, so there\u2019s more cash in the system that can be spent and will circulate in the economy \u2013 paying for goods and services, funding employment and allowing life to continue something like as normal. That, at any rate, is the theory. It\u2019s what central banks do in recessions to stimulate economic activity. When times are better, they raise interest rates to make it more expensive to borrow money and prevent the economy from overheating (including asset bubbles).","title":"Ergo\u2019s approach"},{"location":"uses/use/#the-outer-limits","text":"This is a blunt tool, but it works, up to a point. In the 2008 crisis, the problem was more severe \u2013 so severe, in fact, that interest rates were slashed to zero. Banks were still afraid to lend because they didn\u2019t know the quality of the collateral they were offered in return, those notorious mortgage-backed securities. So the central banks undertook a programme of Quantitative Easing (QE). This entailed creating huge amounts of cash that didn\u2019t exist before, then purchasing various assets from the banks. The idea was that the central bank would take on the risk and the assets, and commercial banks would then use this gift of liquidity to lend to small businesses and individuals, allowing them to continue operating as before. It didn\u2019t work. Little of that newly-created money went to small businesses. Instead, banks used it to shore up their own balance sheets and make their own finances safer, investing only in low-risk assets rather than risky SMEs. Ultimately that cash filtered through to assets like the stock market and property, making the wealthy even more wealthy while the poorer were priced out of the market.","title":"The outer limits"},{"location":"uses/use/#helicopter-money","text":"Today, as we experience the greatest financial challenge of our lifetimes \u2013 greater than even the Global Financial Crisis \u2013 central banks are considering even more unorthodox approaches.

America has discussed giving \\$1,200 to every adult. Other nations are exploring the same idea. But there\u2019s a problem with this, too. Just like the banks, ordinary citizens are worried about their finances. So instead of going out and spending (where \u2018going out\u2019 is even possible), they pay down their debt. That newly-printed money goes nowhere. That\u2019s really as far as central banks can go. But a platform like Ergo can offer different types of money, with different conditions attached via smart contracts, incentivising different behaviour in different circumstances. And that enables a whole different range of monetary policy tools.","title":"Helicopter money"},{"location":"uses/use/#hot-potato-money","text":"In normal times, banks seek to maintain an inflation rate of around 2%. This means money is worth less over time. So instead of saving it all, and seeing the value of their savings fall, citizens have the incentive to spend it and circulate it within the economy. Too much inflation, of course, is a bad thing. Get money printing wrong and you have hyperinflation like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, and your economy collapses. But what if we kept inflation low, but created a limited amount of a special class of money that had to be used quickly if it was to retain its value at all? We\u2019ll call this \u2018hot potato\u2019 money, because it has to be passed on fast. Using a blockchain and smart contracts, this would be a simple matter of creating a new token that could be freely transferred and traded, just like any other token. And it could be backed by reserves (held with the central bank, commercial banks or any other entity). But the difference would be that it has to be spent within a month of receiving it, or those tokens are locked, their value is lost to the holder and the funds that back them are freed up to return to the reserve holder. So this would be regular money that people had to spend: use it or lose it. If they hoard it, it becomes useless. And we can ensure that it is not used to pay down debt by including conditions that ensure it cannot be used by the banking sector. Of course, Ergo\u2019s Sigma protocols can be used to figure out what has been spent, where, without knowing individual spending habits \u2013 enabling even more targeted stimulus. This idea likely has far-reaching implications \u2013 and possibly unintended consequences. What would the result be, for example, of creating different \u2018classes\u2019 of money that were only semi-interchangeable? Would this introduce unwelcome, even dangerous friction? This and other questions would need to be explored further. What\u2019s clear is that central banks are already experimenting with unconventional monetary policy and are fast reaching the end of the road. We can continue that experiment with better, more powerful and targeted tools.","title":"\u2018Hot potato\u2019 money"},{"location":"uses/use/#powerful-but-safe-contracts","text":"Ethereum is an exceptional platform, but there are things it does not do well. Its Turing-complete smart contracts are powerful, but dangerous \u2013 as incidents from The DAO to the Parity wallet exploits have proven, with tens of millions of dollars in collateral damage.

Ergo takes a fundamentally different approach to smart contract development. The team, which has extensive experience with blockchain platforms, frameworks and organisations from Nxt and Waves to Scorex and IOHK, has adopted a declarative model for programming whereby it\u2019s always known in advance how much code will cost to run \u2013 and, indeed, whether it will run precisely as intended. While that might on the surface limit code complexity, it\u2019s nevertheless possible to create Turing-complete scripts by iterating processes across multiple blocks.

But Ergo also incorporates cutting-edge research into new cryptographic processes, using Sigma protocols to enable DeFi applications that would be either complex and messy or simply impossible on other platforms. Sigma protocols are a well-known class of zero-knowledge proofs that allow developers to implement very powerful processes very elegantly. For example, what if you want to build a privacy service that allows any one of a dozen different accounts to spend funds from an address \u2013 but no one can tell who has made each transfer? Such a \u2018ring contract\u2019 is possible with Ethereum, but it would require a clunky and expensive workaround.

DeFi dApps have overloaded the Ethereum blockchain, causing long delays and soaring fees for transactions. Ethereum and many other platforms besides have researched and implemented fixes to address the lack of capacity. However, all of the solutions are imperfect in one way or another. Larger blocks are the obvious but clumsy fix, resulting in centralisation as fewer miners can afford the bandwidth, storage and CPU cycles to participate. Reducing the number of block validators \u2013 another approach taken to increase throughput \u2013 also necessarily centralises the blockchain. Sharding, while potentially very promising, has yet to be implemented successfully, and in some proposed implementations, breaks atomic composability because shards cannot communicate seamlessly. Thus many of the ways projects seek to ensure their blockchains are fit for purpose result in greater centralisation or loss of critical functionality. Marginal gains Ergo\u2019s developers are watching developments in the DeFi space closely, especially some of the proposals that aim to scale blockchains while maintaining security, decentralisation and atomic composability. In the meantime, there is much that can be done to improve blockchain capacity. The concept of \u2018marginal gains\u2019, often applied in sports, is useful: a number of small, incremental gains in different areas all add up to a substantial compound effect. For Ergo, there are several design principles and choices that have been taken to realise efficiencies in different areas. Storage rent is akin to \u2018on-chain garbage collection\u2019, reducing blockchain bloat and lowering the long-term costs of mining, improving economic sustainability. NiPoPoWs (non-interactive proof-of-proof-of-works) enable mobile SPV clients and even lite full nodes , again reducing the barriers to maintaining the network and improving decentralisation. A smart contract language that is finite and clear, without the messiness and possible chain bloat of Turing-complete languages and their unintended consequences. Sigma Protocols , which allow for powerful cryptographic use cases, implemented elegantly and efficiently. As DeFi emerges as a major use case for blockchain, the stakes could not be higher. Blockchains that are fit for purpose will thrive; those that do not allow the functionality to sustain the required transaction load simply cannot establish a foothold. At the same time moving too fast and implementing untested technology is equally dangerous. There are efficiencies to be gained in first-generation blockchains. Ergo continues to prioritise this approach while researching future upgrades.","title":"Ergo\u2019s approach"},{"location":"uses/use/#ergo-blockchain-is-layer-1-protocol-for-powerful-decentralized-finance-contracts-that-builds-advanced-cryptographic-features-and-radically-new-defi-functionality-on-the-rock-solid-foundations-laid-by-a-decade-of-blockchain-theory-and-development-the-proof-of-work-consensus-algorithm-and-underlying-utxo-model-enable-robust-scalability-and-security-ergo-is-also-partnered-with-emurgo-the-commercial-arm-of-cardano-to-improve-research-on-blockchain-and-zero-knowledge-ecosystems-to-check-out-some-smart-contract-deployments-see-our-github-repositories-here-and-here","text":"","title":"Ergo Blockchain is Layer 1 Protocol for powerful Decentralized Finance Contracts that builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development.

It is an open-source, decentralized network that builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. It complements tried and tested principles with the latest peer-reviewed academic research into cryptography, consensus models, and digital currencies.","title":"Why Ergo"},{"location":"uses/use/#evolution-of-ergo","text":"Ergo\u2019s native language, Ergoscript, was created by Alex Chepurnoy, the primary developer of Ergo. Before his work and research with Ergo, Chepurnoy was an IOHK research fellow and served as the project manager of Scorex where he helped design and build its modular blockchain framework. As a core developer of NXT, Chepurnoy was integral in the development of its pure Proof of Stake cryptocurrency, the first of its kind. The work on color coins at NXT was instrumental in developing the necessary foundations for creating advanced markets operating on a blockchain.","title":"Evolution of Ergo"},{"location":"uses/use/#ergoscript-unlocking-financial-empowerment","text":"Ergoscript\u2019s language is founded on the use of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, or \u03a3-protocols (Sigma Protocols). It is a Scala-based language and therefore benefits from the stateless framework which allows for formal verification on contract logic, granting developers and programmers the ability to create smart contracts with features such as ring-signatures, multisignatures, multiple currencies, self-replicating scripts, anti-theft features, and enhanced security. Ergoscript truly increases the creative potential of blockchain technology and allows for an incredible variety of DeFi products and financial services. To further explore the intrinsic properties of Ergo\u2019s \u03a3-protocols, please see Whitepaper II and Whitepaper III on the Ergo Platform website.","title":"Ergoscript - Unlocking Financial Empowerment"},{"location":"uses/use/#a-commitment-to-continued-open-source-community-based-work-and-collaboration","text":"Community is integral to the identity of Ergo while it continues to build financial frameworks that benefit everyday users. The cryptocurrency industry would not exist if not for decades of collaboration between technologists, scientists and mathematicians. Ergo continues the spirit of collaboration for the benefit of humanity by providing tools to disintermediate power and give it to the people. This is paramount to Alex Chepurnoy\u2019s life work. The Ergo Manifesto provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion on Chepurnoy\u2019s inspiration for Ergo. Cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich ordinary people. Their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital. This is what inspired me. This is my dream. I hope Ergo will be useful here. Thousands of small cooperatives and individual entrepreneurs are more important to healthy and sustainable wealth growth around the globe than a couple of corporations hiding profits in offshore heavens. Chepurnoy works directly with a team of 15 developers, some of whom oversee and manage development teams. Ergo\u2019s growing environment strives to maintain a strong synergy between developers, the Ergo Foundation, and other community contributors with the goal of creating high-quality dApps that provide a rich user experience.","title":"A Commitment to Continued Open Source Community-Based Work and Collaboration"},{"location":"uses/use/#ergo-ecosystem","text":"The user experience includes the NFT Auction House , a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin protocol, SigmaUSD , secure and efficient Oracle Pools , and increased financial privacy with ErgoMixer .

Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography offers lots of powerful use cases. The benefit of ZK operations is that not only are they secure, but they\u2019re private. Imagine you find a smartphone on the ground in the park. A woman close by claims it\u2019s hers, but you don\u2019t trust her. Perhaps she just wants the phone. She could give you the unlock code, but then you\u2019d gain information that, as the owner, she wouldn\u2019t want you to have. So, you close your eyes and hold out the phone, and when you open them, the screen is unlocked. She has proved ownership without giving away sensitive information. That\u2019s a simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. The applications in the blockchain world are compelling. Consider a conventional two-of-three multi-sig address on the Bitcoin blockchain. This requires that any two out of three private key holders for that address have to sign a transaction for funds to be moved. It\u2019s a lot more secure than a single-signature address, but it lacks privacy. Anyone can look at the blockchain and know exactly who signed the transaction. With a zero-knowledge signature, no one knows who is responsible for a transaction \u2013 only that the required number of private keys have signed it. Ergo\u2019s Sigma Protocols are excellent for creating composable ZK signatures. In other words, a group of users can get together and create an address with the conditions they specify. For example, five users could create an address that any three of them need to sign to make a transaction. Or the conditions could be more complicated. A startup consisting of seven people could create an address whereby the CEO and CFO both have to sign to release funds, or else any five key holders can sign a transaction (offering an insurance policy if either CEO or CFO is out of action). Ergo has always been a community-driven project, and we\u2019ve always had solid and enthusiastic support from our developers, many of whom prefer to remain anonymous. One of our anons has pioneered a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to form joint spending groups that require a quorum of signatories to make a transaction (since the process for doing this was previously complex, even for more technical users). User \u2018anon_real\u2019 writes : This project contains two separate apps, server and client. The server is accessible by everyone who can propose ideas and ask for funds from a team. On the other hand, every team member has to set up the client app, which will interact with their secret, node, explorer, and server to create the necessary proofs for approved proposals. If a proposal is marked as fully approved (enough approvals have been collected based on the team\u2019s signature), then client apps will generate necessary proofs and transactions in the background without needing any intervention by members. You can find further discussion of the Zero-Knowledge Treasury on the Ergo forum . There are lots of use cases for this application beyond securely spending funds on Ergo. For example, a similar interface could be the foundation of decentralised public key infrastructure (dPKI): a means of generating and managing public/private keypairs to authenticate users and devices, but without the centralised points of failure that exist in trusted PKI setups. A big thanks to anon_real, and we look forward to seeing the ZK Treasury used in the Ergo community!","title":"Zero-Knowledge"}]}
